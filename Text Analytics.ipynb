       "'China exerts a massive amount influence on commodity markets.Â\\xa0 It is said to account for 40 percent of base metal consumption and 23 percent of major agricultural commodities, according to an IMF working paper by Shaun Roache. It\\'s an even bigger market for commodities than the U.S. And since a Chinese hard landing isn\\'t completely off the table, it\\'s worth considering how this would impact commodities. In a new note titled \"What If China Lands Hard?\" Societe Generale\\'s head of commodities research, Michael Haigh writes, that a Chinese hard landing would both lower demand and hurt investor confidence, thereby delivering a double blow to the price of commodities. Societe Generale Gold In a hard landing scenario, some expect all commodities to plunge uniformly. Even gold prices could plunge because China is the second largest consumer of gold. However, gold\\'s reaction is not so obvious. Haigh writes, that the impact on gold was the most difficult to forecast. Their model suggests that a significant drop in Chinese PMIs (which they use as a proxy for a hard landing) would send gold prices surging 15 percent in the first quarter after a hardlanding to $1,963 per ounce. Gold he points out would be the only commodity to experience this initial rally. But it would also decline rapidly after. This fall would be triggered by three key things: Patrick Legland, head of research at Societe Generale wrote that investors polled on the impact of a Chinese hard landing on commodities and stocks were most uncertain about the impact on gold price.Â\\xa0 The average response was for a 5 percent decline, while Asian investors in particular expected a 21 percent decline. A third of those polled thought gold prices would rise in a hard landing scenario. Copper As for Dr. Copper, it is more sensitive to Chinese PMIs than U.S. PMIs considering China consumes five times as much copper as the U.S.. \"Importantly, copper prices no longer lead PMI movements, but follow them,\" according to Haigh. \"This means we can use our economistâ\\x80\\x99s 3% Chinese hard landing GDP scenario â\\x80\\x93 which implies a 40% drop in PMIs - to forecast the demand shock impact on commodity prices...\" In this scenario, copper prices are projected to fall from $8,000/tonne to about $4,500/tonne one quarter after a hard landing. Base metals as a whole are projected to decline about 50 percent. Zinc prices are expected to fall to $1,150 per tonne one quarter after the Chinese hard landing, from $2,010/t. Lead prices are projected to fall to $1,250/t, from $2,283/t. Nickel is projected to fall to $10,000/t, from $17,190/t. Finally, tin is projected to fall to $12,000/t from $23,743/t. Meanwhile, oil is projected to drop to about $77 per barrelÂ\\xa0one quarter after the Chinese hard landing, from current price of about $111 per barrel.\\nThe hardest part of investing can be learning when to get out of your own way.Â\\xa0 As human beings, we are emotional, impressionable, and often a lot less savvy when it comes to investing than we think. That can spell disaster for portfolios. After the fallout of the Great Recession, the SEC commissioned the Library of Congress to researchÂ\\xa0\"Behavioral Patterns and Pitfalls of U.S. Investors,\" a study that shines a harsh light on the shortcomings of individual investors.Â\\xa0 Using sources from this and other reports, we\\'ve highlighted the pitfalls.\\nChinese exports surged 14.1 percent year-over-year (YoY) in December, beating expectations for a 5 percent rise (via Michael McDonough). Meanwhile, imports increased six percent YoY, ahead of expectations of a 3.5 percent rise. Trade balance widened to $31.6 billion, more than consensus of $20 billion. A breakdown by region showed that exports to the U.S. grew 9.6 percent YoY in December, from -2.6 percent in November. Exports to the EU rose 1.9 percent, after contracting 18 percent in November. Exports to Japan however slumped 6.9 percent.Â\\xa0 *Bank of America\\'s Ting Lu, named the third most accurate forecaster on the Chinese economy by Bloomberg, wrote in a note that both imports and exports have \"bottomed out from their lows in mid-2012\" Weakness in the U.S., Europe and Japan will continue to weigh on growth in these areas.  Hard landing watchers pay particular attention to the import data because it has a domestic demand component and offers insight on domestic demand growth as China attempts to rebalance its economy. Moreover, China is often criticized for doctoring its data, but its trade data is widely considered to be one of the most reliable economic indicators. This follows on some disappointing news about loans in December, which came in at 454.3 billion yuan, below estimates of 550 billion yuan. The Shanghai Composite is now up 0.61 percent. Original At 9 p.m. ET China will release its December trade data. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for for imports to rise 3.5 percent year-over-year (YoY), exports to rise 5 percent YoY, and the trade balance to widen to $20 billion. This data would offer insight into whether China\\'s economy really is picking up. Bloomberg BRIEF economist Michael McDonough tweeted this chart ahead of the data that gives us insight into its largest trading partners: Michael McDonough via Twitter Â\\xa0 *Note: Piece was updated at 11:15 p.m. to include comments from Ting Lu and a breakdown of export by region.  SEE ALSO: SocGen Offers A Surprising Forecast For Gold Under A Chinese Hard Landing Scenario &gt; \\nKristian Dowling/Getty Images Oprah Winfrey has announced that she will be doing an exclusive 90-minute interview with Lance Armstrong next week. According to Oprah\\'s press release, \"Armstrong will address the alleged doping scandal, years of accusations of cheating, and charges of lying about the use of performance-enhancing drugs throughout his storied cycling career.\" The interview is described as \"no-holds barred.\" Last week, in a bizarre twist in the Armstrong story, the New York Times reported that Lance Armstrong was considering confessing everything to doping regulators in the hope that they would let him compete again. Following so closely on the heels of that report, it\\'s hard to imagine that Lance Armstrong would sit down with Oprah for 90 minutes to make yet another vehement (and, at this point, absurd) denial--especially after saying he was never going to talk about any of this stuff again. (When Armstrong decided not to defend himself against the doping charges last summer, he issued the latest in a long string of furious denials and said that he was done talking about the past.) And Oprah certainly isn\\'t going to fly all the way to Armstrong\\'s house in Texas just to sit there and ask Armstrong how he\\'s feeling. At least I hope she\\'s not. So it seems reasonable to assume that the purpose of this interview is for Armstrong to finally confess to the doping allegations that he has denied and lied about for years. If so, good. And if this confession includes the first in a long string of apologies, all the better. Because Lance Armstrong owes a lot of people an apology. And a 90-minute interview with Oprah is probably a good place to start. (It\\'s a much better place to start than the doping regulators: There are a lot more important things at stake here than whether Lance Armstrong ever competes in organized sports again.) For what it\\'s worth, I\\'ve spelled out what I\\'d like to hear in this interview below. But first, some background. I was a huge Lance Armstrong fan. He was one of my heroes. The come-back-from-cancer-and-then-win-seven-Tours thing was just mind-bogglingly impressive and inspiring. As was Lance\\'s charity work. In the early days of the doping scandal, I didn\\'t care so much about it: To the extent that I thought about it, I assumed that everyone in the sport did it, and that you had to do it if you wanted to compete. Over the years, as more and more of the evidence came out, I just wanted to know the truth. I wanted to know whether it was even possible for a clean racer to compete against dozens of doped-up racers and still kick their asses year after year. I hoped that it was possible. How can you not hope stories like that are possible? And, for a while, because of Lance\\'s fervent and furious denials, the answer to that question seemed to be \"maybe.\" (Now, it\\'s clear that the answer is obviously \"no.\") As time went on, and more and more of Lance\\'s former teammates came forward and did the brave, bold, and right thing (tell the truth), I admired them for that. And, as Lance Armstrong himself greeted these confessions with more denials and vicious attacks, I gradually lost respect for him. Cycling is a team sport, and Armstrong never would have won those races without the work of his teammates. And for him to come out and trash them for doing nothing more than telling the truth seemed unbelievably selfish and mean. As I think about Lance Armstrong now, in fact, I realize that I\\'m less bothered by the doping than I am by his lying and trashing of his former teammates. I certainly don\\'t condone the doping--it was cheating, and it hurt everyone who didn\\'t dope (most of whom weren\\'t in the peloton, because they couldn\\'t compete)--but I understand it. When everyone you\\'re competing against is doping, I imagine that it\\'s easy to rationalize that doping is just part of the sport. But Armstrong didn\\'t have to lie about it repeatedly. And he didn\\'t have to trash his former teammates for telling the truth and try to destroy their reputations and careers. So, that\\'s what I will be looking for when Oprah sits down with Lance Armstrong next week for what I expect will be a full-blown confession. I will be looking to hear the full doping story, yes. And I will be hoping that Armstrong takes full responsibility for the decisions he made while doing it--including basically insisting that his teammates do it, according to the USADA\\'s allegations. But mostly I will be curious to see whether Armstrong 1) apologizes for lying and trashing his teammates and associates, and 2) appears genuinely sorry about doing it. Because until he does both of those things, I won\\'t really feel like Lance Armstrong has learned anything. And I certainly won\\'t see any reason to root for him again.

Today we got more headlines about stimulus, monetary measures, and all that, so it may be having an impact. \\nThe recent rally in China\\'s Shanghai Composite has some people convinced that the market has bottomed. However, Bloomberg BRIEF economist Michael McDonough has identified a potential red flag.\\xa0 From a tweet he just sent out: A lack of new investors in China may indicate that the ongoing rally is hollow.

Bank of America\\'s Ting Lu, whom Bloomberg ranked the third most accurate forecaster of the Chinese economy, expects imports to rise 3 percent and trade balance to widen to $19.7 billion.\\xa0 He expects exports to rise 4.5 percent on the year as the blow from the strike in California has faded. The weakness in Europe and Japan makes him cautious on exports, but \"the stabilization of export growth since 4Q12 could alleviate the fear of another global crisis and could convince exporters to rebuild inventories.\" Import and export data are considered to be some of the most reliable indicators of the Chinese economy because it is less at risk of statistical adjustments and can be verified by comparing it with trade numbers reported by other companies. Hard landing watchers pay close attention to import data because it has a tremendous domestic component and shows the state of domestic demand growth.\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s an update and upgrade to our mid-2011 post.

Today White House press secretary Jay Carney was asked about whether The White House saw the coin as a viable option, and rather than shooting it down he just evaded the question. The response from the media has been unanimous: Carney left the door open. Here\\'s the front of Marketwatch.com:  Here\\'s HuffPo:  Here\\'s POLITICO:  Brian Beutler at Talking Points Memo has the best take on what happened today: Todayâ\\x80\\x99s White House press briefing changes things. If I had to, Iâ\\x80\\x99d still bet against the Obama administration minting a platinum coin to meet payment obligations, even if we breach the debt ceiling. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s just a feeble attempt at mind reading. By contrast, the fact that Jay Carney neither foreclosed on the seigniorage option nor questioned its legality today is actually meaningful. Remember, he and Obama (and Obamaâ\\x80\\x99s lawyers) have explicitly rejected the argument that the 14th Amendment empowers the administration to ignore debt limit. They havenâ\\x80\\x99t left themselves any wiggle room on that idea. Felix Salmon has a good post today on the game theory of #MintTheCoin (do you pre-announce that you might use it?). Clearly it\\'s become part of the conversation. For more on today\\'s historic press conference, see here &gt;\\nMy latest visit to India coincided with the celebrations of Navratri culminating in the day of the Dussehra, which symbolizes the victory of good over evil as exemplified by Lord Ram killing the demon king Ravana. The festive season starts from the Navratri and continues until Diwali, several weeks later. In Delhi, my team and I had the privilege of attending one of the many Dussehra celebrations taking place all over the country, an event with some of Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s most prominent officials in attendance. When we arrived, the situation was a bit chaotic, with people milling about and pushing to get onto the grounds, but at the same time it was a festive atmosphere. Purveyors were offering local delicacies such as â\\x80\\x9croller ice cream,â\\x80\\x9d which is made by dripping an ice cream mixture over a hand operated roller filled with ice and salt, as well as the roomali roti bread (handkerchief bread) which is made by flattening a ball of dough and tossing it in the air to stretch to the thickness of a handkerchief, then baking it on a heated dome. At the celebration site, there were three 10-meter tall paper and wood effigies of Ravana and two of his family members with red blinking eyes. At the right moment, all the dignitaries were handed richly decorated bows and arrows which they shot in the direction of the effigies, symbolizing the Ram killing the three demon kings. A fireworks display followed, and the effigies went up in spectacular flames. This ceremony was duplicated all over Delhi and other cities in India. I think the most remarkable aspect of the ceremony was that although there were security people at the entrances, security was largely absent inside and near the official podium. As we traveled to and from the celebrations and to other meetings in India, to us it really brought home the burgeoning traffic crisis there. My team and I visited Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru (formerly known as Bangalore) and some more remote corners of the country during this trip. The migration of farmers from rural areas to cities combined with the explosion of car and motorcycle ownership is creating infrastructure bottlenecks, which wonâ\\x80\\x99t likely be cured quickly.Â\\xa0 Motor Vehicles in India An Indian \"tuk tuk\" India appears to be on its way to becoming a major market for motor vehicles. Annual car and truck sales currently in India are roughly one third of the 15 million units produced in the U.S.,Â\\xa0but the pace of growth has been high.1 The total population of registered motor vehicles in India numbered more than 100 million in 2008- 2009, with consumer vehicles (passenger cars, motorcycles and scooters) accounting for about 4/5 of the total. Considering Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s population of 1.22 billion, if India had the same proportion of vehicles per capita as the U.S. (which numbers some 246 million vehicles 2)Â\\xa0it would require about 970 million automobiles!Â\\xa0 I think the industryâ\\x80\\x99s potential is easy to see. More prominent than cars and trucks in India are the two-wheelers (motorcycles and motor scooters) with annual sales running at about 14 million3 in addition to about a half million famous â\\x80\\x9ctuk tukâ\\x80\\x9d three-wheelers seen serving as open air taxis on the streets of India, Thailand and other parts of the emerging markets world. The infrastructure required to handle the swelling traffic is already bursting at the seams. Although there are about 5 million kilometers of roads in India, only a fraction are national or state highways or urban roads which would be considered of reasonable quality. 4 To get a better insight into the industry, we visited a large automobile manufacturing company in India, which produces both consumer and commercial vehicles. Production of one of its popular low-cost vehicles has been running about 9,000 units a month. I was surprised to learn from one of the executives that a large part of the firmâ\\x80\\x99s revenues now came from recently acquired foreign brands. This is evidence of the trend weâ\\x80\\x99ve seen in the past few years, where many emerging market companies have been acquiring developed-market brands, or engaging in joint ventures. My team and I also visited another vehicle manufacturer which specialized in two-wheelers for more insight into Indiaâ\\x80\\x99s market for motor scooters and motorcycles. Annual sales were brisk not only in their domestic market but neighboring markets, as well as Africa. They also manufacture â\\x80\\x9cthree-wheelers,â\\x80\\x9d which serve as taxis all over Asia. When we met with one of the founderâ\\x80\\x99s sons at their corporate office and R&amp;D center, he reported being very focused on these more energy-efficient and space-saving forms of transport. In the past, it was difficult for India to compete against the Japanese in the vehicle market, but this company in particular seemed to have found some success. Its executives felt there were two reasons why people might choose a motorcycle over a car or other form of transportation: Â\\xa0to commute and for sport. There has been a trend toward larger and faster motorcycles to satisfy not just the basic needs of commuters, but to also supply the excitement of a powerful and fast sport vehicle. Thus, they launched products with larger motors, and a premium brand name. From these visits, it is clear to me that India is motoring toward an interesting future, one filled with investment potential in infrastructure development and transportation. 1.

According to PrivCo\\'s sources, Foursquare is missing venture capitalist\\'s projections, and even its own projections, quarter after quarter. PrivCo thinks investors will get tired of this and sell their shares by year-end for less money than they initially invested. Specifically, PrivCo thinks Foursquare will be acquired for less than $50 million by the end of 2013, significantly less than the $71.3 million investors have pumped into it. Its reasoning is this: Aside from missing quarterly projections, PrivCo says Foursquare has struggled to raise a new round of financing for \"nearly a year.\" More so, it says Foursquare\\'s existing investors have \"made it clear to Foursquare management including CEO Dennis Crowley that they will not be investing additional capital into Foursquare either.\" PrivCo says it\\'s their way of warning Crowley that he must find a sustainable business model quickly. We have to assume the investors PrivCo is talking about are Union Square Ventures, a long-time investor in Foursquare, and Andreessen Horowitz, which led Foursquare\\'s last round of financing and helped value the company at $550 million in July 2011. As further proof, PrivCo reads between the lines of a recent blog post written by Union Square Ventures\\' Fred Wilson, which stressed frustration with startups. Wilson wrote, \"So if I can give entrepreneurs a single piece of advice for 2013 it would be to deliver on your promises. Not just to your investors but also to your team and ultimately to yourself. This is no time to be in denial. That is a lethal attribute in times like these.\" Union Square Ventures opted not to comment on PrivCo\\'s report or its satisfaction with Foursquare\\'s performance to date. We should note that Fred Wilson isn\\'t the USV investor involved in Foursquare though. It\\'s his partner, Albert Wenger, who is on Foursquare\\'s board. PrivCo also used Foursquare\\'s flat web traffic as a sign of bad times ahead. It says its website has hovered\\xa0 between 2.2 million and 2.5 million monthly uniques for the past year and a half. \"This shows that not only is Foursquare\\'s audience too small for a consumer-oriented Internet company to attract meaningful ad dollars, but its web traffic numbers are flat, with no reversal on the horizon; this is a likely death spiral for a consumer social network,\" PrivCo writes. Of course, Foursquare is first and foremost a mobile app and it hasn\\'t pushed particularly hard to increase monthly uniques to its website. The report does note that Foursquare\\'s users logged 1.9 billion minutes on the app in 2012, up 15% from 2011 according to Nielsen. Foursquare also added 15 million new accounts this year, bringing its total users to nearly 30 million. There have been more than 3 billion check-ins to date on the app. What to make of it all? It\\'s true that investors aren\\'t keen on investing at the moment. It\\'s also been reported that Foursquare only generated $2 million this year, which we have to assume is a big miss for both investors and the company. But in the report, PrivCo made some blatant errors. For one, it incorrectly named Dennis Crowley\\'s co-founder, Naveen Selvadurai, \"Naveen Jain.\" PrivCo makes money selling the business and financial research it collects on private companies. One way it seems to be making a name for itself is by publishing very negative reports about startups. It did this with Groupon and Facebook. (Then again, some of those reports proved to be accurate.)\\xa0 If PrivCo is right, it means the investors that will take the biggest hits are Union Square Ventures, O\\'Reilly Alphatech Ventures, Ron Conway and David Lee\\'s SV Angel, Bijan Sabet\\'s Spark Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz. But they\\'ll receive cash back before common stockholders see a dime. The person who would obviously get hit the hardest is Dennis Crowley, who\\'s spent his entire life trying to solve one problem: finding his friends who are nearby. Foursquare declined to comment for this story. (PrivCo is a company that collects business and financial data on private companies)\\nwikimedia commonsThe theme of World Economic Forum\\'s Global Risks 2013 report,Â\\xa0just out this week, is \"resilience.\" It includes a newÂ\\xa0a \"nationalÂ\\xa0resilience measurement\" to determine which countries are best positioned to manage catastrophe.Â\\xa0 But no country would be able to bounce back from some of the risks included in the survey. We picked out 13 of the more bizarre scenarios the Forum envisions.\\nA country\\'s personal income tax rate is only one indicator of how much tax an individual actually ends up paying on their income, according to a report by KPMG. \"Our broader analysis further emphasizes the point that other taxes and the impact of deductions clearly need to be considered...Interestingly, the difference between top tax rates and effective combined tax and employee social security rates shows that neither of the two countries with the largest top marginal tax rates (Aruba and Sweden) feature among the top five countries when we use either USD100,000 or USD300,000 as a basis for comparison,\" write the authors. \"Whether social security is a true tax is a topic of continued debate, but in terms of cost, it can be material and should not be ignored.\" For someone with a gross income of $100,000 a year, these are the forty countries in which they would have to shell out the most for, tax and social security combined.

Abe has been very vocal about pumping fiscal stimulus into the economy in a bid to end Japan\\'s decades-long struggle against deflation. He\\'s also threatened to turn central banking upside down by stripping the Bank of Japan of its independence and revamping its mandate \\x96 an unprecedented move in the modern world. There is a good argument to be made that Abe is really just bluffing about the BoJ and pursuing more radical monetary policy. His background as a politician who has fought his whole career to move Japan to the right on social issues suggests that perhaps he is just talking down the yen, so to speak, just long enough to be able to shift his focus back to implementing the controversial social policies he seems to care so much about. Regardless of Abe\\'s true intentions, though, the yen has, in fact, weakened dramatically since September: Bloomberg, Business Insider The argument goes that part of the magic of the yen\\'s decline is a boost in competitiveness for Japan\\'s big exporters \\x96 globally recognized brands in automotive and tech like Toyota, Honda, Sony, and the like. This, in turn, could finally get the moribund Japanese economy going and ultimately stoke a little inflation. However, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Nobuyuki Saji argues that those potential gains are overstated, and a much worse fate could belie the Japanese economy if the yen continues to weaken. In a note to clients entitled \"Weaker yen could make Japan a nation of poor seniors,\" Saji writes: The fact that Japan has a trade deficit in everyday necessities means that a weaker yen will reduce the household sector\\x92s real income. At the risk of exaggeration, we could say that depending on how far the yen depreciates, Japan could slip to the level of an impoverished country by becoming a poor importer. Let us look back on Japan\\x92s trade deficit in food, now about ¥5.3trn, and how it has changed due to food import prices and the ¥/$ rate over the past 15 years. There have been three yen-weakening phases since 1990. The first lasted from May 1995 to July 1998 and took the exchange rate from ¥83.2/$ to ¥143.7/$, which marked yen depreciation of 72.7%. The second lasted from December 1999 to February 2002 and saw the yen depreciate by 31.0%. The third lasted from November 2004 to June 2007 and saw the yen depreciate by 19.4%. Over these three phases, the yen-based import price of food rose by 28.1%, 19.0%, and 35.3%, respectively. Therefore, the rates at which importers were able to pass on higher costs in their selling prices were 38.6%, 61.1%, and 181.8%, respectively (change in import prices / change in yen\\x92s value).  The third yen-weakening phase occurred when the Chinese economy was very active (annualized GDP growth of 12.7%), causing grain prices to shoot up. Nevertheless, in the period since 1990, which largely overlaps with the peak-out (1992) and decline of Japan\\x92s economically productive age group, importers have been able to pass on an increasing proportion of forex-related price increases to their customers. This can only be because the production capacity of domestic companies making competing products has declined. Incidentally, in the yen-strengthening phase since June 2007, the yen has appreciated 35.4% while food import prices have declined by only a slight 5.0%. What about other everyday necessities such as textiles (clothing, etc.)? Since 1990, the rates at which importers have passed on forex-related price increases in yen-weakening phases have been 43.9%, 12.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. In the yen-strengthening phase since June 2007, textile prices have risen 0.2% even as the yen has strengthened by 35.4%. As with food, textile prices tend to rise in yen-weakening phases, but they resist decline in yen-strengthening phases. This is evident from 15 years of data. To sum all of that up, big downward moves in the value of the yen typically mean that Japanese consumers \\x96 increasingly comprised of aging seniors \\x96 pay up quite a bit more for food than they did before. Making matters worse is Japan\\'s ballooning trade deficit in food \\x96 the Japanese are increasingly reliant on imports to feed themselves, making the declining value of the yen even more significant. We do not deny that a weaker yen would be positive for the earnings of Japanese companies, but in macroeconomic terms a weaker yen does not have the same export-boosting power that it used to. Instead, we must not overlook the fact that a weaker yen will raise the prices of everyday necessities and thus lower the real incomes of the Japanese people. Even as Japanese society ages, there is a limit to\\xa0how much people can cut back on consumption of goods where import dependence is high, such as food, clothing, and energy. We cannot rule out the possibility that the household savings rate will turn negative. Japan\\x92s ballooning fiscal deficit is starting to show signs of becoming unmanageable (rapidly rising national debt). The possibility is rising that trade deficits and current account deficits will become entrenched as the norm. If Japan is starting to face triple deficits, it means the United States and Japan have traded places and the weaker has become the stronger over the past 30 years. If Japan falls into triple deficits, we will have to prepare for drastic yen depreciation. Incidentally, the exchange rate we calculate based on PPP in manufactured products is ¥83/$, while the exchange rate we calculate based on PPP for the basket of CPI goods is ¥125/$ (comparing US and Japanese prices). That last bit about purchasing power parity is telling. When Saji calculates the dollar-yen exchange rate based on manufactured products \\x96 the domain of large Japanese exporters \\x96 it\\'s very close to the official rate, which currently stands at ¥87.90 per dollar. However, the yen buys considerably less when looking at goods in the consumer price index basket \\x96 which is much more heavily weighted toward items like food, energy, and clothing. flickr / Takato Marui Abe would love it if those two exchange rates calculated by Saji were switched \\x96 but they\\'re not. Weakening the yen in a bid to boost exports is a flawed strategy from the get-go, a remnant of the legacies of former Japanese prime ministers, including Abe\\'s grandfather himself. In the process, Abe could end up leaving the Japanese economy in a much more dangerous position than before.\\nEveryone\\'s making a huge deal out of the news that hedge fund manager Dan Loeb is long Herbalife. (And they should, because it means war with Pershing Square\\'s, Bill Ackman). But in all our excitement over a good knock-down, drag-out hedge fund fight we shouldn\\'t forget that Loeb\\'s Third Point had a solid year (up 21.2%) thanks to its long positions in Greek government bonds, AIG, Yahoo, Murphy Oil Corp, and Delphi Corp. And it should also be noted that Loeb has picked up a long position in another one of today\\'s news makers, Morgan Stanley. Earlier the bank announced that it would be cutting 1600 jobs, and the market liked it. Here\\'s why Loeb likes Morgan: During the Fourth Quarter, we initiated a position in Morgan Stanley (MS), which we believe is in the early innings of a turnaround. The bankâ\\x80\\x99s investment banking advisory and equity sales and trading businesses â\\x80\\x93 which we know well from our perspectives as both investors and long-time satisfied clients â\\x80\\x93 have consistently won top three market shares and are impressively positioned. Although MS has historically failed to capitalize on its strengths, its leadership currently is focused on growing its good businesses while consolidating and successfully fixing its previously troubled Wealth Management business. In 2013, we expect Morgan Stanley to tackle its other weak business, Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities (FICC) sales and trading. Morgan Stanley\\'s stock currently trades at a 20% discount to tangible book (down from a 35% discount when we acquired our stake at an average cost of $16.77 per share), and we view MS at these prices as a chance to buy a free call option on a promising restructuring. Loeb also tipped his hat to the bank\\'s CEO James Gorman and said that he think has Morgan Stanley\\'s management has the stuff to deal with the the company\\'s problem areas. Plus, overall, the he thinks world\\'s macro picture will improve, which is great for deals. We\\'ll find out if that optimism shows up in Morgan\\'s earnings next week.\\nDepartment of LaborSecretary of Labor Hilda Solis has resigned from the Obama administration, according to The Associated Press. Solis has served in the Obama administration since her confirmation in 2009, and she is the fifth member of the administration to leave Obama\\'s Cabinet since he won re-election. In a statement released by the White House, Obama thanked Solis for her service. Here\\'s Obama\\'s full statement: Over her long career in public service â\\x80\\x93 as an advocate for environmental justice in California, state legislator, member of Congress and Secretary of Labor - Hilda Solis has been a tireless champion for working families. Over the last four years, Secretary Solis has been a critical member of my economic team as we have worked to recover from theÂ\\xa0worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and strengthen the economy for the middle class.

Â\\xa0 It\\'s common for several departures to take place between the first and second term of a presidency, but Solis\\' departure â\\x80\\x94 coupled with the exits of EPA administrator Lisa Jackson and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton â\\x80\\x94 mean that the administration is losing another woman.

The last time we hit that mark was in 1989, according to oil markets guru Stephen Schork. One of the major beneficiaries of this surge has been the railroad industry, he writes. And among all rail companies, BNSF may be best positioned to take advantage of shipments of crude from America\\'s oil boom. Three years ago, of course, Warren BuffettÂ\\xa0boughtÂ\\xa0BNSF railroad for $26 billion. It\\'s looking like a wise investment. â\\x80\\x9cWeâ\\x80\\x99re the 1,000-pound gorilla in the oil markets,â\\x80\\x9d BNSF CEO Matt Rose told Bloomberg. â\\x80\\x9cCrude by rail is going to be really strong for us.

Carney laughed and sidestepped the question, repeating that it is Congress\\' job to raise the debt ceiling and that President Barack Obama would not negotiate with Republicans. \"Nothing needs to come to these kinds of speculative notions\" like the trillion-dollar coin, Carney said.\\xa0 Nevertheless, Todd continued to press Carney multiple times about the trillion-dollar coin option. Carney did not explicitly rule it out, but he said there was \"no backup plan\" if Congress didn\\'t do its job. \"There is no Plan B. There is no backup plan,\" he said. In the last question of the press conference, ABC reporter Jon Karl asked Carney for an explicit \"yes or no\" on the coin option.\\xa0 \"I would refer you to the Treasury,\" Carney said. The \"Mint the Coin\" movement has gained traction in the past week as an option to circumvent the debt ceiling if Congress does not raise it by the expected \"X date\" that could come as soon as Feb. 15. It would allow the Treasury to temporarily print money to pay the country\\'s bills and work around the debt ceiling. It has turned into a\\xa0Twitter\\xa0campaign (#MintTheCoin),\\xa0and supporters have created a petition urging the White House to mint it. Incidentally, Carney was much more definitive in his position on whether Obama would consider the option of the 14th Amendment to work around the debt ceiling. The amendment states that \"the validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned.\" Carney\\'s answer on the 14th Amendment was a firm \"no.\" \"Our position on the\\xa014th Amendment\\xa0has not changed,\" Carney said. \"Congress has the responsibility and the sole authority to raise the debt ceiling.\"\\nThis morning we learned that Dan Loeb is long nutritional supplement company Herbalife, and now we know why. Loeb hashed out his thesis in his latest letter to investors \\x97 his hedge fund, Third Point is up 21.2 percent for 2012, and 9.2 percent for Q4, by the way \\x97 and said that fellow hedge fund manager Bill Ackman\\'s short against the company is \"preposterous.\" After going over Herbalife\\'s awesome stats ($29.87 billion in sales with 20-50 percent growth each year since 2004). Loeb gets to the heart of why the company is not a pyramid scheme, as Ackman has said. From the letter: The pyramid scheme is a serious accusation that we have studied with our advisors. We don\\'t believe it has merit. The short thesis rests on the notion that the FTC has been asleep at the switch, missed a massive fraud for three decades and will shortly awaken (at the behest of a hedge fund short seller) to shut down the company. We find this to be preposterous. He goes on to say that the FTC\\'s regulatory framework makes it possible for multi-level marketing companies to conduct business legally. Not only that, but he adds that while Ackman\\'s presentation was \"lengthy\" there was \"little new \\'news\\' in the presentation\" or evidence to show that Herbalife had crossed into breaking the law. ... even the short seller conceded that the FTC was not looking at Herbalife\\'s practices. In our experience, expert regulators like those at the FTC do not respond to sudden pressure from a hedge fund whistleblower by acceding blindly to their demands. Finally, even if there were some regulator intervention, we are comforted by the fact that 80 percent of Herbalife\\'s revenues come from overseas. Here\\'s how it ends: So we return to our compounder thesis, available at an attractive discount, probably for a limited time only. We believe that continued strong operating performance combined with disciplined capital return could easily send the stock back towards its April highs. Let\\x92s not forget: the business itself is performing well. Volume, revenue and earnings are all growing double digits and the balance sheet is largely unlevered. Management has a history of returning 100 percent of net income to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. If management were to deploy its existing $950 million buyback authorization in the $40-45 range (only taking leverage to approximately 1.5x), we estimate that run-rate EPS for 2013 could be $5.50-5.70 using the reduced share count. Applying a modest 10-12x earnings multiple suggests Herbalife\\x92s shares are worth $55-$68, offering 40-70 percent upside from here and making the company a compelling long investment for Third Point. Given that the Company has historically traded more in the 12-14x range (and traded at 16-20x earnings through much of 2011 and early 2012), the opportunity for the Company to tell its side of the story tomorrow at its Analyst Day in New York, and the significant short interest, we believe shares could even trade well above our current price target. This is very similar to another Herbalife long, John Hempton, who has made the same argument. Yes, there are some business model issues, but the FTC is not going to act on them on the behest of a billionaire hedge funder.

He added that the White House has determined \"executive action can be taken,\" but he did not specify what action that could be. It was the first suggestion from the White House that it could bypass Congress in instituting measures to combat gun violence in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The White House has already called on Congress to reinstate a ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004, close loopholes that allow gun buyers to bypass background checks and ban some high-capacity magazines. \"I want to make clear that we\\'re not going to get caught up in the notion that, unless we can do everything, were going to do nothing,\" Biden said Wednesday.

According the Washington Post, Wall Street\\'s powerful lobby group, The Financial Services Roundtable (FSR) will be working hard against the Republican party to see the debt ceiling raised. The group is headed by former GOP Presidential candidate, Tim Pawlenty. From WaPo: â\\x80\\x9cWe are in favor of raising it, and we will be encouraging policy makers to increase it,â\\x80\\x9d Scott Talbott, the senior vice president for public policy for the Financial Services Roundtable, told me today. He added that the group was gearing up to communicate the demand for action to Congress, an effort that could include sending letters to every member. â\\x80\\x9cWe will communicate with the entire Congress,â\\x80\\x9d he said. The FSR and the people they represent are afraid of what will will happen to markets if the ceiling isn\\'t raised. No one, after all, wants a repeat of the summer of 2011 when the S&amp;P cited the brutal debt ceiling debate as a reason for downgrading the U.S.\\'s credit rating. â\\x80\\x9cThe markets have baked in the fact that Congress will make the shot at the buzzer,â\\x80\\x9d Talbott said. But he warned: â\\x80\\x9cIf they donâ\\x80\\x99t make the shot, the first trading day after, the markets will go haywire.â\\x80\\x9d The FSR\\'s voice on this matter could actually make an impact on Republican lawmakers? Why? Because the FSR is a big GOP donor, that\\'s why. In 2012 the group had a bit less than half a million dollars to shell out, and 69% of that went to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.com. So we\\'ll see how the GOP deals with this one.\\nWikimedia CommonsWe\\'ve been seeing a recurring theme in some of the recent market commentaries emanating from Wall Street. It\\'s the second week of the new year, and there hasn\\'t been a whole lot of activity in the markets â\\x80\\x93 which means everyone is still discussing 2013 outlooks, predictions, surprises, and so forth. A comment from a recent client note authored by JPMorgan strategist Tom Lee â\\x80\\x93 known as one of the more bullish voices on the Street â\\x80\\x93 caught our interest. Lee wrote: Our baseline for 2013 remains that of a tricky 1H, with strength to start (and as we mentioned in earlier notes, we see a move toward 1500) but followed by a correction that sees 1350 before midyear. This is a contrarian view on timingâ\\x80\\x94we are seeing a growing chorus of investors who see stocks strong throughout 2013. In fact, even notable bears have turned â\\x80\\x9cbullishâ\\x80\\x9d on equities in 2013.Â\\xa0We do not view this as a sign of â\\x80\\x9cringing the topâ\\x80\\x9d; rather, it is a reminder that investors need to be mindful of consensus and risks to the consensus view. Today, another well-known Wall Street bull â\\x80\\x93 BMO Capital strategist Brian Belski â\\x80\\x93 wrote something very similar: Looking forward, we remain optimistic and expect another year of above-average market gains for the U.S. market (our 2013 S&amp;P 500 price target is 1,575, implying a roughly 10% gain) despite what we expect to be a slowing earnings growth environment. However, for the first time in quite a while our market outlook is squarely within the consensus. Although the contrarian part of us is uneasy about this, we are comfortable with our stance. From our perspective, most other strategists have finally caught up to where we have been all along. In addition, so long as volatility (as measured by the VIX) remains subdued, as we expect, having a consensus call is not necessarily a bad thing, in our view. In other words, some of Wall Street\\'s most bullish strategists are starting to take note that everyone else is finally joining the bandwagon, so to speak. This consensus view is also central to Doug Kass\\'s 2013 outlook, published today on TheStreet.com. In the piece, Kass highlighted just how little deviation there is on Wall Street from the consensus call that stocks will gain 10 percent in 2013: On the latter issue of stock prices, strategists are unusually tight in their year-end S&amp;P 500 forecasts, with Bank of America,Â\\xa0Bank of Montreal, Citigroup,Â\\xa0Credit Suisse,Â\\xa0Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs,Â\\xa0HSBC,Â\\xa0KKR,Â\\xa0JPMorganÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0OppenheimerÂ\\xa0all in the range between 1550 and 1615, representing, on average, about a 10% gain for the full year.Â\\xa0BTIGÂ\\xa0andÂ\\xa0BarclaysÂ\\xa0are at 1525. OnlyÂ\\xa0UBSÂ\\xa0(1425) and Morgan Stanley (1434) stand out from the crowd. So, is the \"unusually tight\" consensus on a 10 percent rise in the stock market in 2013 cause for concern?Â\\xa0(For more detail, readÂ\\xa0Wall Street\\'s Predictions For Where The Stock Market Is Going In 2013.) As Lee and Belski wrote, they aren\\'t too worried about it. Kass, on the other hand, is. In his outlook, he writes: As contrasted to 2012, when most were dour in market view (and wrong!), the 2013 consensus is an optimistic one and now holds to the view that European economic growth is stabilizing while growth in China and in the U.S. is reaccelerating. The popular view goes on to believe that even our dysfunctional leaders in Washington will not upset the growing consensus that it is clear sailing for equities and trouble ahead for bonds. ... These consensus views might prove too optimistic on stock prices and too pessimistic on bond prices. I believe that the U.S. stock market will make its 2013 high in the first two weeks of January, be in a yearlong range of 1275-1480 and close the year at 1425 and that the 10-year U.S. note will be below 2.00% in the first six months of 2013. Either way, it\\'s something for contrarians to think about. On a related note, Credit Suisse equity strategist Andrew Garthwaite identified eight sentiment indicators near or at multi-year highs.

The average temperature in northeast China dipped to -4.5 degrees F, the coldest in 43 years, and dropped to a 42-year low of -18.7 degrees F in northern China. We\\'ve told you how this has inflicted major damage on crops, in turn causing prices to surge. Now we\\'ve dug up some images showing the damage.Â\\xa0\\nBloomberg via YouTubeAs emerging economies evolve into developed economies, their GDP rebalances and shifts from being driven by investment to being driven by consumption. This is a phenomenon that we\\'re beginning to see in China as the world\\'s second largest economy starts to mature. However, investors often make the mistake of assuming that when construction slows, it\\'s time to dump infrastructure stocks and move into consumer stocks. There\\'s much more nuance to the China story, noted Deutsche Bank\\'s David Bianco at a breakfast this morning. \"China construction growth can slow, buts its capital goods demand can accelerate,\" said Bianco. For years, China has focused its efforts on building airports, highways, and cities.Â\\xa0 However, it still needs to deploy capital goods for all of that infrastructure. \"China demand for capital goods should accelerate as urban living standards improve.Â\\xa0 China still needs more airplanes, trucks, engines, climate control and automation.\" With this thesis in mind, Bianco recommends investors to tilt their portfolios toward \"global growth\" and \"capex plays.\"Â\\xa0 Specifically, he favors industrial and technology sector stocks with exposure to the emerging markets. Deutsche Bank\\'s year-end target for the S&amp;P 500 is 1,575.\\nFormer Congressman Barney Frank served the state of Massachusetts as a Democrat for decades in the House, and now there\\'s a grassroots movement to get him sent to the Senate \\x97 if even for just a little while. Since It looks like Massachusetts Senator John Kerry will be confirmed as Secretary of State when Hilary Clinton steps down, there\\'s going to have to be a special election for his seat. Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick is responsible for appointing a temporary Senator until someone is officially elected, and people are putting pressure on him to choose Frank for that spot. A semi-retired senior from Norfolk, Massachusetts named John F. Kelley started a petition to get Frank in the seat. Right now it has 4,878 signatures and the goal is 5,000. \\x93At a time like this, we need someone with the courage, the conviction and the experience to stand up for seniors and working families in Congress\\x97and we can\\'t think of anyone who would do a better job over the next few months than Barney Frank,\\x94 said Kelley.\\xa0 \\x93Barney Frank has never been afraid of a fight, and if appointed to the Senate to replace John Kerry, he won\\'t back down in defending working families and seniors like me.\\x94 There\\'s that, and there\\'s the op-ed the Boston Globe staff wrote urging Patrick to appoint Frank. ...Frank is an excellent candidate for interim senator. Choosing him would serve two important purposes. First, since he\\x92s emphatically ruled out any future election, his selection would allow the voters to choose a permanent senator without having one of the candidates anointed by the governor. Second, he would be effective immediately as a senator, since he\\x92s about as knowledgeable on federal budget issues as anyone in Congress. That\\x92s crucial because budget cutting will be the prime agenda item for the next four months. And Frank, who\\x92s toiled fruitlessly in the Republican-led House alongside GOP gadfly Ron Paul on a plan to trim the defense budget, would finally get to make his case in the Senate. For his part, Frank has said that he would accept the position. Looks like it could very well be a done deal.\\nNaturally, he\\'s outraged about the whole mess, and he\\'s directing that outrage at the insurance company\\'s former CEO, Hank Greenberg. It makes sense. Greenberg is the man who filed the initial suit on behalf of AIG shareholders alleging that the U.S. government handled the company\\'s bailout in a manner that was contrary to their interests. That argument was dismissed in a NYC Court, but the case was allowed to proceed in Washington D.C. That\\'s where AIG\\'s board could join in, if they so choose, after hearing arguments for and against the suit at a meeting today. Now here\\'s Taibbi\\'s take: But here\\'s the funny thing about the lawsuit filed against the government: It isn\\'t all wrong. In fact, parts of it are quite on the mark. The only problem is, the suit is being filed by maybe the biggest douchebag of all time, Hank Greenberg (and his company, Starr International), a man who has not only been proven to be corrupt and a fraud, but who perhaps more than anyone else was responsible for the galactic balance-sheet goat-f*ck that caused AIG\\'s implosion in the first place. If there is such a person as an innocent AIG shareholder who was harmed by the government\\'s conduct, it sure as hell isn\\'t Hank Greenberg. Business Insider also pointed out that, during his tenure as CEO, Greenberg oversaw the creation of the unit that made the risky bets that brought the company to the brink of collapse. Taibbi goes into the gory details of all that: Well, AIG, under Greenberg\\'s watch, had entered into hundreds of billions of dollars of cosmically stupid credit default swap bets with all of the biggest banks in the world, essentially taking book for all of Wall Street, in many cases taking the wrong side of bets against the mortgage markets, among other things. Greenberg was dumb enough to allow his subordinate Joe Cassano to enter into these contracts, which were written in such a way that if AIG\\'s credit rating were ever to fall, AIG would suddenly owe its customers billions in cash collateral. When the ratings agencies started downgrading AIG because of anxiety over all of the investigations into the company\\'s accounting, all of those collateral calls started coming due. Before you knew it, companies like Goldman were demanding more cash in collateral than AIG had, and when the company was finally bled dry, that\\'s when the bailout took place. All that said, Taibbi does grant Greenberg one little piece of satisfaction. He writes that the powers-that-be on Wall Street \"absolutely did conspire to seize AIG and then use a monstrous mixture of AIG\\'s assets and public money to keep themselves alive.\" In essence, AIG was the helpless fat guy in the lifeboat who got eaten when the rest of the survivors ran out of food. In a vacuum, perhaps, there might be some sort of claim here, and there are ordinary people who worked for AIG who were probably harmed when the state decided not to force companies like Goldman to take even a 1 percent haircut on their CDS contracts with the firm. But Hank Greenberg, the guy who started all of this mess by monkeying with shady reinsurance deals and signing off on the bank\\'s incredibly irresponsible bookmaking during the pre-crisis years, is not the guy to bring that claim. So in short, down with Hank, and also, down with Wall Street. Got it.

Currently, the index is at its lowest level since June 2007. \"If there\\'s a line in the sand for the VIX, it looks to be right around 10,\" they write.\\xa0 \"While the VIX has dipped below 10 briefly in the past, it hasn\\'t stayed there for long.\"  However, the chart also shows that whenever the VIX reaches a periodic low, it tends to spike upwards shortly thereafter.

Washington opted for its same olâ\\x80\\x99 strategy when averting the â\\x80\\x9cfiscal cliff,â\\x80\\x9d as the addictive nature of â\\x80\\x9ccan-kicking is a transatlantic sport,â\\x80\\x9d according to The Economist. The magazine suggests that the deal made in the 11th hour is â\\x80\\x9cdisturbingly similar to the eurozoneâ\\x80\\x99s.â\\x80\\x9d The short-term fix did â\\x80\\x9cnothing to control the unsustainable path of â\\x80\\x98entitlementâ\\x80\\x99 spending on pensions and health care â\\x80¦ nothing to rationalize Americaâ\\x80\\x99s hideously complex and distorted tax code... and virtually nothing to close Americaâ\\x80\\x99s big structural budget deficit.â\\x80\\x9d In the end, politicians agreed to end the payroll tax cut and raise taxes on the top earners; altogether, tax increases will total $162 billion in 2013. According to a Bloomberg article, itâ\\x80\\x99s the first time since 1990 a Republican leader agreed to a boost on tax rates. The legislation also represents the largest tax increase in two decades, says the Wall Street Journal. One negative consequence resulting from the new bill is an immediate hit to Americansâ\\x80\\x99 spending cash. International Strategy &amp; Investment (ISI) anticipates that the impact will occur in the first quarter of this year, with real disposable personal income (income after taxes and inflation) decreasing by 3.8 percent, says ISI. In addition, â\\x80\\x9creal consumer spending is likely to remain sluggish at 1.5 percent,â\\x80\\x9d says ISI. Avoiding the â\\x80\\x9cfiscal cliffâ\\x80\\x9d initially calmed the market, with equities and gold beginning to rally before the ink was dry. On January 3, I appeared on Fox Business to discuss the impact on gold and whether the yellow metal had the strength to increase for the 13th year in a row. I said that the lack of fiscal austerity combined with monetary reflation would keep fueling gold throughout 2013. See the clip now. Â\\xa0 However, the Federal Reserve poured a bucket of cold water on gold after its minutes were released, with some members documenting their wish to stop quantitative easing (QE) before the end of 2013. While this appears to be a negative for gold, keep in mind that the Fed has always been divided, but when opinions diverge, leadership prevails, says ISIâ\\x80\\x99s Roberto Perli. Chairman Ben Bernanke, along with William Dudley and Janet Yellen, continue to hold the belief that more accommodation is required. In addition, the conflicting comment was made in the context of the labor market, so if we see QE end by the middle of this year, â\\x80\\x9cit will be because the economy is getting stronger, and that would be a bullish development,â\\x80\\x9d says Perli. Regardless, we are seeing developed countriesâ\\x80\\x99 central bankers adopting very unconventional monetary policies these days, and â\\x80\\x9cthe base case for investors must remain that, when the pressure is really on, the choice will be made for yet more easing and yet more bailouts,â\\x80\\x9d says Christopher Wood from CLSA. Itâ\\x80\\x99s likely that the latest round of easing by the Fed was because Bernanke anticipated a reduction in spending and wanted to offset the hit taken by the consumer due to the tax increases. And historically, during times of QE, money flows to riskier assets. A few weeks ago, I showed how money was heading to emerging markets, and itâ\\x80\\x99s worth repeating, as the trend has continued in the new year. Since QE3 began in September 2012, $37 billion has flowed into emerging markets. In total, during 2012, nearly $50 billion flowed into emerging markets, with three spikes occurring in January, February and December. Â\\xa0 Back in April 2012, I suggested that if you apply the principle of mean reversion, history appeared to favor Chinaâ\\x80\\x99s H shares to land in the top half of emerging markets on an annual returns basis. With a new leadership in place and its economy improving, investors have begun to gain confidence in the Asian giant, and in response to the significant flows, equities in China began to outperform other emerging countries, ending the year as a top-half performer on the Periodic Table of Emerging Markets.

FIRST: the movement has gone absolutely nuts. Everyone is talking about it. Media outlets and individuals include: BBC, Fox News, CNN, PIMCO\\'s Bill Gross, Paul Krugman, Reuters, The Guardian, Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Bloomberg, MSNBC, CNBC, NBC, CBS, ABC, The Australian, Ria Novosti (Russia), Stephen Colbert, The Washington Post. That\\'s just a partial list. SECOND: Despite the supposed absurdity of it, and despite the fact that it flies in the face of everything everyone thinks about money, there are virtually no good arguments against it. The only real argument is: it sounds silly. Virtually nobody disputes the economics, and the legality is now pretty much unquestioned. Furthermore, attempts at rebuking the coin have made people sound like fools. Think about that, you\\'re going up against a trillion dollar coin, and it\\'s you who ends up sounding like a fool. Here\\'s the National Republican Campaign Committee revealing that it doesn\\'t\\' understand the way coin seigniorage works.

In his \"15 Surprises for 2013,\" published today on TheStreet.com, Kass writes: Once again, the bullish consensus is tightly grouped with the expectation that the S&amp;P 500 will close the year at 1550-1615 (up from 1425 at the close of 2012) and that the 10 year U.S. note yield will trade at 2.50% or higher (up from 1.80% at the close of 2012). These consensus views might prove too optimistic on stock prices and too pessimistic on bond prices. I believe that the U.S. stock market will make its 2013 high in the first two weeks of January, be in a yearlong range of 1275-1480 and close the year at 1425 and that the 10-year U.S. note will be below 2.00% in the first six months of 2013.

According to Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, however, this process is extremely flawed and there\\'s a much better way. Kahneman\\xa0learned in his days as a psychological evaluator for the Israeli Army how hard it is to judge people by intuition.\\xa0The army\\'s interview procedure was \"almost\\xa0useless for predicting the future success of recruits,\" he writes in his book Thinking, Fast And Slow. So the young officer designed a better evaluation system, working from the\\xa0insights of psychologist Paul Meehl, who argued that simple statistical rules are superior to intuitive judgments. What he came up with was so controversial it almost caused a mutiny. Kahneman asked interviewers to put aside personal judgments and limit interviews to a series of factual questions meant to generate a score on six separate personality traits. A few months later, it became clear that Kahneman\\'s systematic approach was a vast improvement over gut decisions. It was so effective that the army would use his exact method for decades to come. Why you should care is because this superior method can be copied by any organization \\x97 and really, by anyone facing a hard decision. Kahneman says as much in\\xa0Thinking, Fast And Slow: Suppose that you need to hire a sales representative for your firm. If you are serious about hiring the best possible person for the job, this is what you should do. First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on. Don\\'t overdo it \\x97 six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1-5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call \"very weak\" or \"very strong.\" These preparations should take you half an hour or so, a small investment that can make a significant difference in the quality of the people you hire. To avoid halo effects, you must collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate add up the six scores ... Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the highest, even if there is another one whom you like better \\x97 try to resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking. A vast amount of research offers a promise: you are much more likely to find the best candidate if you use this procedure than if you do what people normally do in such situations, which is to go into the interview unprepared and to make choices by an overall intuitive judgment such as \"I looked into his eyes and liked what I saw.\" Kahneman\\'s book also discusses the cognitive failings of\\xa0financial advisors,\\xa0amateur investors,\\xa0pundits, and\\xa0pretty much everyone.\\xa0 DON\\'T MISS: The 25 Hardest Companies For Job Interviews &gt;\\nDaniel Goodman / Business InsiderClockwise, starting at left: Dylan Love, Jay Yarow, Abby Rogers, and Erin Fuchs.A couple of years ago, I revealed a lot of internal information about Business Insider--the sort of information that most companies paranoically guard for a litany of stated reasons.

The European Bailout That Everyone Forgot About Is Running Into Trouble &gt;\\nAPBloomberg is reporting that President Barack Obama will name current Chief of Staff Jack Lew to be the next Treasury Secretary on Thursday, where he will succeed Tim Geithner. It has\\xa0already been a busy week for Obama\\'s Cabinet reshuffle. On Monday, he nominated former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to be the next Secretary of Defense and\\xa0John Brennan,\\xa0the White House homeland-security and counterterrorism adviser, to be the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency.Here are some things you need to know about Lew: Lew grew up in a middle-class apartment in Forrest Hills, Queens, where he started taking up causes like building low-income housing, according to The New York Times. At 12 years of age, he campaigned in New York for Sen. Eugene McCarthy\\'s presidential campaign.\\xa0 \\'\\'Pretty exciting for a 12-year-old,\\'\\' Lew told the Times in 1999. \\'\\'It was also my introduction to seeing that you could make a difference in people\\'s lives through politics.\\'\\' He ended up getting a degree from Harvard. Later, while in Washington, he picked up a law degree from Georgetown by attending classes at night. Lew began his time\\xa0Washington in 1973 as legislative aide on Capitol Hill, including as a domestic policy adviser to former House Speaker Tip O\\'Neill when Ronald Reagan was President. He worked in an office with MSNBC\\'s Chris Matthews. \\x93When he said \\x91Pell grants,\\x92 it wasn\\x92t something distant or numerical,\\x94 Matthews told the Times. \\x93He knew this meant kids could go to college who didn\\x92t have rich parents.\\x94 As an aide, he helped negotiate a deal to reform Social Security in 1983. From February 1993 to October 1994, Lew served as a Special Assistant to the President in the Clinton administration. After a hiatus, he returned to the White House in 1995 as the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. In 1998, he was promoted to be the Director of the OMB. Lew played a key role in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which helped Clinton leave office having created a surplus.\\xa0 Most prominently, he gained his only experience on Wall Street as a managing director at Citigroup beginning in 2006. After his appointment to the Obama administration in 2010, he caught some fire \\x97 especially from liberals \\x97 for the stint.\\xa0 Lew oversaw a unit that, among other strategies for job creation, bet against the housing market. Citi paid Lew $1.1 million for his year at Alternative Investments, according to an ethics disclosure report filed in January 2009. He was also eligible for an undisclosed bonus. Lew did not immediately return a call for comment. His unit, though, lost as much as billions of dollars in 2008 as its bets turned sour. In the first quarter of 2008 alone the unit lost $509 million; the company stopped publicly disclosing the unit\\'s individual numbers soon thereafter, but the part of the company that absorbed Alternative Investments lost $20.1 billion in 2008, according to the bank\\'s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup, the nation\\'s third-largest bank, received $45 billion in TARP bailout funds that year. He was the Deputy Secretary of State under Hillary Clinton for nearly two years before Obama tapped him to replace Peter Orszag as the Director of the OMB. That was where he first outlined the administration\\'s deficit-reduction proposal, including returning to Clinton-era tax rates on the top 2 percent of incomes. In the 2012 budget, he also proposed $400 billion in savings through\\xa0non-security discretionary spending freezes and $78 billion in defense cuts while lowering corporate tax rates to 25 percent. Via\\xa0National Journal,\\xa0Lew prefers a careful approach to budget-cutting: \\x93I describe budgets as a tapestry: When it\\x92s woven together, the picture amounts to our hopes and dreams of a nation.\\x94 Obama replaced outgoing Bill Daley with Jack Lew last January, when criticism on Lew\\'s Citigroup tenure started to intensify. Along with Director of Legislative Affairs Rob Nabors, Lew immediately became one of Obama\\'s most-trusted allies and took a leading role in the debt-ceiling negotiations of 2011. NPR detailed how some of his forward-thinking steps gave the White House the edge in the fiscal cliff talks this year: \"The White House was very forward-looking and strategic in the way they shaped the sequester,\" [former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden Jared] Bernstein says. \"This is a very tough situation for Republicans, in no small part because of the skill of the negotiators from the Democrats\\' side.\" For instance, in making sure that programs like Medicare, Pell grants or food stamps are not on the chopping block when the automatic spending cuts hit. Instead, it\\'s defense spending and the Bush-era tax cuts that are at risk \\x97 things that are Republican priorities. Bernstein says Lew gets a lot of the credit for that. \"Jack Lew\\'s fingerprints are all over the parts of this sequester that protect vulnerable people, whether it\\'s exempting the entitlements or many of the things that help low-income families,\" he says. \"One of the things Jack always deeply understood was just how important that role of government is for people who are retirees, for people who are poor, for people who aren\\'t connected to the economy and the market in the way that a lot of Republicans envision everybody is, but they\\'re really not.\" If confirmed, Lew will be tasked again with leading the Obama team in talks on the next round of fiscal issues \\x97 the debt ceiling (again), the sequester and the appropriations budget. Politico\\'s Manu Raju detailed\\xa0why some Republicans could look to block his appointment \\x97 because, quite simply, they do not like his views or how he negotiates.\\xa0 It wasn\\'t always that way.\\xa0The feelings began stemming after Lew\\'s role in the debt-ceiling negotiations. In fact, during the negotiations, Lew was praised by, of all people, Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor: \\x93No one was more prepared and more in tune with the numbers than Jack Lew. He was always very polite and respectful in his tone and someone who I can tell is very committed to his principles.\\x94 But now, Republicans say they feel that Lew has no interest in \"hearing GOP concerns.\" It comes after Lew reportedly scoffed at a GOP proposal to make the estate tax rate permanent. \"We\\x92ve got to have a person who has credibility with the leaders of the American and world economy, someone who has credibility with the Congress, and I would feel like Mr. Lew\\x92s nomination would be a mistake,\" Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions told Politico. During his 2010 confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee, Lew told the panel that he did not believe Wall Street deregulation played a major part in the financial crisis. He said he doesn\\'t \"personally know the extent to which deregulation drove it, but I don\\'t believe that deregulation was the proximate cause.\" Via New York Mag\\'s Stefan Becket: \\nJamie Dimon is back to being blunt and out front. Bloomberg reports that JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that some JP Morgan executives \"acted like children\" when they heard about the errant \\'London Whale\\' trade that eventually cost the bank over $6 billion last year. He was speaking at a JPM conference in San Francisco. From Bloomberg: â\\x80\\x9cInstead of helping, they were running around with their head chopped off, â\\x80\\x98what does this mean for me personally, howâ\\x80\\x99s my reputation?â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Dimon said yesterday...Some people â\\x80\\x9cfelt they could take advantage of it personally, they were willing to hurt the company by maneuvering.â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9cWe had 100 people who worked every day for 90 days to help the real problem -- the risk -- not the ongoing regulatory review, but the real problem, to get the risk down so we didnâ\\x80\\x99t have ongoing exposure,â\\x80\\x9d Dimon said. While some people â\\x80\\x9cacted terribly,â\\x80\\x9d the bank now has the â\\x80\\x9cbest management team Iâ\\x80\\x99ve ever had in my entire life,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cYou learn the good and the bad about people and thatâ\\x80\\x99s invaluable to find out who those people are. Invaluable,â\\x80\\x9d he said. Dimon also said that he told executives, some of whom were in tears, that it would take months for the bank to recover its image as the best bank on the Street. â\\x80\\x9cThey are going to attack me, they are going to attack the company. Iâ\\x80\\x99m off my high-holy horse,â\\x80\\x9d Dimon, 56, said he told his public relations and investor relations staff. â\\x80\\x9cIt is what it is, donâ\\x80\\x99t worry about it.â\\x80\\x9d There\\'s a lesson in there somewhere, people.\\nPhoto by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images At the end of this year, when Apple\\'s cheap iPhone comes out, it is going to be amusing to listen to all the Apple fans who consoled themselves about Apple\\'s loss of market share by dismissing competitors\\' phones as \"cheap plastic crap.\" Because the new cheap iPhone is supposed to have a cheap plastic back. (Presumably, Apple fans will regard Apple\\'s cheap plastic back as having been designed perfectly, unlike the usual cheap plastic crap.) But more importantly... Apple\\'s decision to finally launch a cheap iPhone is a great move by the company. It\\'s a move that is at least a year late, unfortunately, which has helped Apple lose a lot of global market share to competitors like Samsung. But it\\'s still a great move. Why? Because the explosive growth in the smartphone market has now shifted to emerging markets like China and India, where there are few carrier subsidies and most people can\\'t afford phones that cost $600. By insisting on maintaining the premium prices of its phones, Apple has missed out on this growth in the past couple of years. (And Apple has also lost its edge at the premium end of the market, but that\\'s a different story.) To be sure: Apple\\'s decision to offer a $99-$149 phone will reduce the amount of profit that Apple makes per phone. And, relatedly, it will likely reduce Apple\\'s profit margin. But that\\'s okay. Apple\\'s profit margin is still extraordinarily high--the highest in the industry, by a mile. Apple\\'s profit margin, even after accruing for taxes that the company mostly doesn\\'t pay, is an astounding 26%. Y ChartsApple profit margin: Too high.No other hardware companies have margins that are anywhere close to that high. Apple\\'s profit margin, in fact, is too high. Apple has sacrificed revenue growth and platform growth by deciding to confine itself to the \"premium\" market. And, meanwhile, Apple has raked in such an astounding amount of profit that Apple has no idea what to do with the cash piling up on its balance sheet. Apple has so much cash that it doesn\\'t know what to do with, in fact, that it has decided to start paying a dividend. In other words, Apple has traded off long-term investment opportunities for short-term profits. And, on a global market share basis, it\\'s paying the price for that. Compare this \"short-term profit-maximization\" approach to the approach of another great company, Amazon, which continually reinvests its profits in future opportunities and lower prices. When Amazon has enough resources to make a bet on a big new opportunity--the Kindle, for example, and Amazon Web Services--Amazon goes ahead and invests the money. This reduces its profit margin, which causes some short-term shareholders to scream, but over the long haul, as long as some of these bets pay off, it creates more value. And even when it isn\\'t making big bets, Amazon continually reinvests potential profits by reducing prices for its customers. This increases Amazon\\'s value to its customers and its competitive advantage. And those, too, help create more value over the long all. Even if it sells hundreds of millions of super-cheap iPhones, Apple will still have a healthy profit margin. And its global market share, which is important in a \"platform\" business (third-parties build services and apps on top of the iPhone), will increase. This is a worthy tradeoff, even if it causes some short-term investors to jettison the stock in disgust. The growth in the smartphone market is moving to lower-priced phones. And Apple can afford to reduce prices even on its premium phones. So the fact that Apple is acknowledging at least the former trend is very encouraging. It shows that Apple does not want to make the same mistake it made in the 1990s: Focusing on pricing and profit over market share. And it shows that Apple, unlike many companies that under-invest in the future just to deliver bigger profits today, is worthy of its reputation as a great company.

Meanwhile, the U.S. economic recovery continues to be anemic.Â\\xa0 And the biggest symptoms of that are the weak labor market and low wages.

The Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin solution to get around the debt ceiling is unambiguously legal, according to Laurence Tribe, the constitutional law legend at Harvard Law School. Ryan Cooper at Washington Monthly got him on record: I donâ\\x80\\x99t think it makes sense to think about this as some sort of â\\x80\\x9cloopholeâ\\x80\\x9d issue. Using the statute this way doesnâ\\x80\\x99t entail exploiting a loophole; it entails just reading the plain language that Congress used. The statute clearly does authorize the issuance of trillion-dollar coins. First, the statute itself doesnâ\\x80\\x99t set any limit on coin value. Second, other clauses of 31 USC Â§5112 do set such limits, but Â§5112(k)â\\x80\\x94dealing with platinum coinsâ\\x80\\x94does not. So expressio unius strengthens the inference that there isnâ\\x80\\x99t any limit here. Of course, Congress probably didnâ\\x80\\x99t have trillion-dollar coins in mind, but thereâ\\x80\\x99s no textual or other legal basis for importing this probable intention into the statute. What 535 people might have had in their collective â\\x80\\x9cmindâ\\x80\\x9d just canâ\\x80\\x99t control the meaning of a law this clear. Meanwhile, Paul Krugman delivers his THIRD enrosement of #MintTheCoin with a point about how it\\'s core to how people see money: For many people on the right, value is something handed down from on high It should be measured in terms of eternal standards, mainly gold; I have, for example, often seen people claiming that stocks are actually down, not up, over the past couple of generations because the Dow hasnâ\\x80\\x99t kept up with the gold price, never mind what it buys in terms of the goods and services people actually consume. And given that the laws of value are basically divine, not human, any human meddling in the process is not just foolish but immoral. Printing money that isnâ\\x80\\x99t tied to gold is a kind of theft, not to mention blasphemy. For people like me, on the other hand, the economy is a social system, created by and for people. Money is a social contrivance and convenience that makes this social system work better â\\x80\\x94 and should be adjusted, both in quantity and in characteristics, whenever there is compelling evidence that this would lead to better outcomes. It often makes sense to put constraints on our actions, e.g. by pegging to another currency or granting the central bank a high degree of independence, but these are things done for operational convenience or to improve policy credibility, not moral commitments â\\x80\\x94 and they are always up for reconsideration when circumstances change. This gets to what we were saying yesterday. This debate is not the work of frivolous trolls. This gets to the core of what is money.\\nAPDemetris ChristofiasAfter some time out of the limelight, European politicians are bringing contentious bailout negotiations back to center stage in the euro crisis plot line. In June of last year, Cyprus requested a bailout from the \"troika\" of eurozone creditors at the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. The small eurozone member\\'s outsized banking system was rocked by the Greek bond swap that took place earlier in the year â\\x80\\x93 Cypriot banks were big holders of Greek debt and were forced to take serious writedowns as part of the deal, which necessitated a bailout from the state. This, in turn, forced Cyprus to request aid from the troika. The deal between Cyprus and the troika still has not been consummated, and today, reports surfaced in the German press that the deal will be postponed until March, and Cypriot banks may require even more cash to be recapitalized than was previously expected. The new estimate isÂ\\xa0â\\x82¬11 billion, up fromÂ\\xa0â\\x82¬9 billion. That doesn\\'t sit well with Germany â\\x80\\x93 given the Cypriot banking system\\'s reputation as a \"black money\" haven for Russian cash â\\x80\\x93 and that means the Cyprus negotiations could become yet another stumbling block for European leaders trying to navigate the ongoing crisis. A headline in the German newsmagazineÂ\\xa0Der Spiegel summed up the situation very succinctly in November: \"EU Aid for Cyprus A Political Minefield for Merkel.\" Today,Â\\xa0German leaders on both sides of the parliamentary aisle revealed that there wasn\\'t much support in the German legislature for the Cyprus deal. \"If the impression would persist that the German taxpayer has to be liable for black money in Cyprus, then aid would not be justifiable,\" Rainer BrÃ¼derle, who heads the FDP political party, a junior coalition member in the German government, told the German newspaper Bild. The opposition said basically the same thing. Sigmar Gabriel, the leader of SDP, told German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, \"As things currently stand, I can\\'t imagine German taxpayers bailing out Cypriot banks, whose business model depends on abetting tax fraud.\" The November Der Spiegel articleÂ\\xa0mentioned aboveÂ\\xa0focused on a classified intelligence report prepared by the German intelligence agency BND on money laundering in Cyprus, and exposed just how pervasive the Russian money laundering through Cyprus had become since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Der Spiegel also explained German Chancellor Angela Merkel\\'s bind: sign off on a controversial bailout of Cypriot banks funded by German taxpayers, or risk the financial spillovers that could hit the eurozone otherwise. So, Germany and the troika have demanded of Cyprus the same tough economic reforms and privatizations of state assets that have characterized bailouts of other eurozone member states, like Greece. However, CypriotÂ\\xa0President Demetris Christofias, a communist, has refused to comply with those requests. This is why reports in the German press today say the negotiations between Cyprus and the troika have been delayed until March â\\x80\\x93 Cyprus holds presidential elections in mid-February, and Christofias is likely to be unseated by a conservative. The troika is hoping he will be a little easier to work with. Today, in a press conference, Merkel declared, \"We agree it is important that the troika should talk with Cyprus and that there can be no special conditions for Cyprus because we have common rules in Europe,\" and said that \"we are far from the end of the talks.\" In November, BofA Merrill Lynch FX strategistÂ\\xa0Athanasios Vamvakidis warned that \"CyprusÂ\\xa0could prove to be a blind spot that could add to market concerns about theÂ\\xa0Eurozone crisis.\" Although many view Cyprus as a tiny economy without the potential for much spillover, Vamvakidis still provided a few things for investors to think about: If Cyprusâ\\x80\\x99 debt ends up as high as the above estimates suggest, officialÂ\\xa0sector losses may be difficult to avoid, creating a precedent with implicationsÂ\\xa0for other periphery countries. A private-sector debt haircut would haveÂ\\xa0negative market implications for the Eurozone, suggesting that Greece wasÂ\\xa0not a unique case after all and triggering concerns that other countries couldÂ\\xa0follow. However, beyond such concerns, there is not much private-sectorÂ\\xa0debt to cut. The share of private-sector debt in Cyprus following a programÂ\\xa0will be very small. Moreover, the bonds under domestic law, which are theÂ\\xa0ones most likely to be affected by a haircut, amount only to â\\x82¬2.35bnÂ\\xa0(excluding bonds issued for bank recapitalizations and/or used as collateralÂ\\xa0for bank ECB borrowing), which is 13.3% of GDP and only 1.1% of theÂ\\xa0highest estimated debt level under a program. Any official sector debt reliefÂ\\xa0for Cyprus could lead to similar demands in other periphery countries andÂ\\xa0strengthen political opposition to the periphery bailouts in the core EurozoneÂ\\xa0countries. Concerns that Cyprus, and not Greece, may be the first country to exit theÂ\\xa0Eurozone could come to the fore. We do not believe that it is in the interest ofÂ\\xa0Cyprus to exit the Eurozone, particularly because of geopolitical concernsÂ\\xa0and the continued dispute with the occupied territories in Northern Cyprus. Moreover, Cyprus could in theory default on its official debt and remain in theÂ\\xa0Eurozone, as its primary deficit is very small. However, markets couldÂ\\xa0become concerned about a Cypriot exit after they realize the risks to theÂ\\xa0countryâ\\x80\\x99s debt dynamics. In other words, the situation hasn\\'t blown up yet, but it is something to keep an eye on, nonetheless.\\nYoutubeThe New York Times\\' John Broder and Clifford Krauss report that an urgent review of Arctic drilling by the Department of the Interior could scuttle all of Shell\\'s production plans there. \"Officials said the new assessment by federal regulators could halt or scale back Shell\\x92s program to open Alaska\\x92s Arctic waters to\\xa0oil\\xa0exploration, a $4.5 billion effort that has been plagued by equipment failures, legal delays, mismanagement and bad weather,\" they write.

Since then, the company has paid back the $182 billion the American people lent it, but now former CEO Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg wants to sue the government for punitive damages stemming from the terms of that loan. Greenberg\\'s basic argument is that the terms hurt shareholders. And while one New York City Judge dismissed that claim with prejudice, a Washington D.C. Court is allowing the trial to proceed. That\\'s where AIG\\'s board will decide if they want to join in or not. Greenberg (represented by his company Starr International) is requesting $25 billion in damages. In a statement yesterday, AIG CEO Bob Benmosche said that his company \"mean(s) it when we say thank you to the American people,\" but at the same time, according to the company\\'s release, the board only has three options: The Board has three options with respect to the derivative claims asserted on its behalf: (1) take over Starr\\x92s claims and prosecute them on its own; (2) refuse the demand and prevent the claims from being prosecuted by Starr, a decision Starr is likely to challenge; or (3) allow Starr to prosecute the claims on AIG\\x92s behalf. Importantly, the Court of Federal Claims has denied the Government\\x92s motion to dismiss the suit, so that the case will go forward with or without AIG\\x92s participation. If AIG does not allow the derivative claims to proceed on AIG\\x92s behalf and Starr prevails or obtains a favorable settlement on its direct claims, then AIG will not receive any of the amounts recovered. Both options 1 and 3 would really tick off the American people, and according to Fox Business News\\' Charlie Gasparino, AIG management is telling people they\\'re not going to happen. After all, Washington politicians have already started sounding off about how \"outrageous\" a lawsuit would be. Some have said that AIG shouldn\\'t \"even think about it.\" That leaves option two, which is really interesting because it pits AIG against its former CEO and its brother company. Starr and AIG were both founded by Cornelius Vander Starr, it was he who appointed Greenberg to succeed him as the head of both companies in the late 1960s (check them out together here). Hank Greenberg held both positions simultaneously from 1967 to 2005 when he stepped down from AIG over allegations that he engaged in some creative accounting at the firm (he eventually paid out a $15 million fine). Based on their statement, AIG is not interested in having Starr go on with this case without it because it would risk losing the chance for more government money if Greenberg is successful in Court. Their option, then, if they don\\'t join in the suit, is to go to battle with Starr to stop it from suing the government.

Herbalife, the distributor of its own nutritional products. Hedge funder Bill Ackman is famously short Herbalife, likening it to an illegal pyramid scheme, which he hopes/expects the government will go after. Today it\\'s been revealed that hedge funder Dan Loeb has now gone LONG Herbalife, taking a massive 8.2% stake. The stock has spiked on the news. Ackman first announced his short with a dizzying multi-hour presentation that he delivered near the end of December. The premise of the short was that the stock was a pyramid scheme, and that the government could be induced to investigate the company, causing it to go to zero. Ackman\\'s short is understood to be massive. While Herbalife plunged initially, the stock has recovered somewhat, as some have questioned the plausibility of the bet. Among those already betting against Ackman is blogger John Hempton, who thinks his thesis is preposterous.

None of this should come as a surprise. Morgan Stanley\\'s CEO James Gorman has always made it clear that Wall Street had to downsize and that he wasn\\'t afraid to have his own employees feel the pain. That goes for compensation (down 9% since last year) and layoffs. The truly ugly year was 2011, when the firm was running layoff scenarios in the several thousands. At the beginning of last year, Gasparino (again) reported that by June 5,000 more people would be gone. This falls in line with some dark predictions about what would happen all over the Street that we\\'ve been tracking for some time. When Detusche Bank announced 1900 layoffs this summer, Meredith Whitney swooped in and said it was just the beginning. She predicted 50,000 job cuts and lower compensation across the board even though the financial meltdown was, at that point, 4 years in the past. In the long run this is a good thing for the Street, according to Whitney. Banks simply aren\\'t making enough cash to support the staffs they used to have, and shareholders aren\\'t going to stand for banks that \"over capitalized and sluggish.\" That\\'s what\\'s causing the voluntary downsizing you see here (from Whitney, this summer): \"You can make great money in a utility type of business by borrowing cheaply and lending sensibly but that\\'s not what\\'s being done. The basic bank model has, is, and will be attractive. It\\'s just you\\'re combining everything and undercutting pricing in one place and trying to make up for it, effectively having loss leading businesses... it\\'s not a business that works.\" Strong words \\x97 and then she really dug in. \"You\\'re either making money or you\\'re not. If you\\'re not making money get out of the business.\" When Detusche Bank made its announcement this summer, the company\\'s stock jumped. Morgan Stanley\\'s is creeping up as well.

Bloomberg\\'s Hans Nichols reports that Obama will name Jack Lew as Treasury Secretary tomorrow. Lew, who is currently Obama\\'s Chief Of Staff, has been seen as the frontrunner for a long time. Previously he was Obama\\'s budget chief, and previous to that he was at Citi. While Lew is seen as likely being an easy nomination, there is some GOP opposition to him. POLITICO\\'s Manu Raju had a good report on the politics surrounding Jack lew today: Lew has irked powerful Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell during tense negotiations to raise the debt ceiling as well as the final round of talks to avert the fiscal cliff at the end of 2012. Several Republicans said Tuesday they donâ\\x80\\x99t view Lew as a man interested in hearing GOP concerns. One aide called him â\\x80\\x9ctone deafâ\\x80\\x9d in understanding the compromises that Republicans could accept during high-stakes talks. A lot of the frustration seems to be about his bargaining style.

The coin idea has drawn supportive comments from folks like Paul Krugman and a former director of the U.S. Mint.Let\\'s start with the Debt Ceiling itself.It came up during World War I.\\xa0 Prior to the ceiling, every bond issued by the U.S. had been individually authorized by Congress. With war debt piling up rapidly and fearing that some accidental Congressional inaction would inhibit war efforts; Congress handed over issuance to the Treasury.\\xa0 But, to keep some control, they set a limit, or ceiling, to the total amount of debt that could be issued.\\xa0 To exceed it, Treasury would have to go back and have Congress authorize further debt (bonds).Since the ceiling is now viewed as a partisan Rubicon, Washington is resorting to zany solutions to get around it.Some believe that the ceiling itself may be unconstitutional, since it may violate the Article IV of the 14th Amendment mentioned above.\\xa0 Since we may hit the ceiling limits in early March, there is hardly enough time for a Supreme Court challenge.\\xa0 Then there is the question of who the plaintive would be, and would he/she/they have \"standing\".The sequestration (massive cuts) deadline has been moved to March 1.\\xa0 The temporary spending authority (under which the government is operating) expires late in March.These deadlines will likely morph with the Debt Ceiling for a massive sumo wrestling match in the final weeks of February.\\xa0 Here we go again \\x96 only this time a quick, cheap, imperfect solution may not be within reach.\\nFresh off a big 2012 that saw him rise to national prominence\\xa0in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey Gov.

Its brands range from entry-level Å\\xa0koda to exotic Bugatti, with SEAT, Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, and Lamborghini in between. It wants to reduce overcapacity in Europe â\\x80\\x9con the backs of the French,â\\x80\\x9d the source said. But now a secret plan has seeped from the woodwork at the Ministry of Financeâ\\x80\\x94a desperate, misbegotten, taxpayer-funded deal.Â\\xa0 The new car market in France is morose. Sales in 2012 dropped 13.9% from the miserable levels of 2011. PSA sank even deeper into that quagmire, with sales dropping 17.5%. All hopes had been riding on its new Peugeot 208 that hit the streets in the fall. But hope has turned into disappointment. An initial restructuring plan was nixed by the government. Nevertheless, PSA will shutter its plant at Aulnay (Seine-Saint Denis) and lay off 8,000 people ... by 2014 Â\\xa0[As Cars Burn In France, The Industry Of HopeÂ\\xa0Booms]. The company has been bleeding cash. Its finance subsidiary, Banque PSA Finance, was bailed out by taxpayers last fall to the tune of â\\x82¬7 billionâ\\x80\\x94a bailout that came under heavy fire from Renault, Ford, and the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns 20% of Volkswagen. Saving PSA without major restructuring, and layoffs, has become a government priority. Economy Minister Pierre Moscovici, who is rumored to be close to the Peugeot familyâ\\x80\\x94which owns 30% of PSAâ\\x80\\x94dropped some hints about the secret plan Sunday evening. He was discussing PSA, â\\x80\\x9ca strong companyâ\\x80\\x9d that happened to be in a â\\x80\\x9csevere crisis.â\\x80\\x9d More government help? â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s without doubt necessary to go further,â\\x80\\x9d he said. â\\x80\\x9cIt would be up to the executives to initiate the rapprochement that they find useful, and we are here both to accompany them and to weigh in that direction.â\\x80\\x9d Then the leaks emerged. â\\x80\\x9cIf car sales collapse in Europe as they did in 2012, PSA wonâ\\x80\\x99t make it through the first half,â\\x80\\x9d a source at the Ministry of Finance told Le Monde. Bailouts are designed to protect stockholders, bondholders, and other stakeholders, especially the eliteâ\\x80\\x94such as the Peugeot familyâ\\x80\\x94at the expense of taxpayers. A real restructuring through a bankruptcy, after the model of GM, would wipe out the Peugeotsâ\\x80\\x99 investment and would slam the banks that own much of the debt. Not a good option. Hence the secret plan. The government is deeply worried about Volkswagenâ\\x80\\x99s strategy of lowering its prices in Europe. The source explained the thinking: Volkswagen can afford it as it sits on â\\x82¬25 billion in cash, but PSA cannot afford it. A form of governmental dementia. Volkswagen, despite lowering its prices, is immensely profitable. Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a perceived pile of cash that gives it the power to lower prices, but its operating efficiencies, cost structure, and booming sales in China and the US. But even Volkswagenâ\\x80\\x99s sales dropped 5.1% in France last year. The marauders in Peugeotâ\\x80\\x99s and CitroÃ«nâ\\x80\\x99s backyard were Kia and Hyundai whose sales, albeit a fraction of those of the giants, jumped 18.1% and 42.2% respectively! Nevertheless, to throw a monkey wrench into Volkswagenâ\\x80\\x99s presumed strategy of wiping out PSA, the government has come up with an ingenious plan: push PSA to acquire GMâ\\x80\\x99s European subsidiary that has been bleeding to death for years, and whose sales in France have crashed last year by 23.8%â\\x80\\x94Opel. Simple: take two dying cats and make a healthy one out of them. And do so without major surgery. Or, as Le Mondeâ\\x80\\x99s source would have it, build a European champion able to resist the German attacks. The idea had bubbled up in September as PSA and GM were nitpicking through the details of their new alliance. GM ought to trade Opel for more shares in PSA. But GM rejected it; it was already stuck with 7% of PSA and didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to get dragged deeper into the quagmire. GM had also been scared off by hot-headed declarations of various government officials in response to PSAâ\\x80\\x99s now nixed restructuring plan. Explains the source at the Finance Ministry: â\\x80\\x9cThe only way to convince the Americans would be for PSA to buy Opel directly.â\\x80\\x9d There are some roadblocks. PSA doesnâ\\x80\\x99t have the means. It would require an infusion of government capital, which has been discussed over the last few months, particularly during the Banque PSA Finance bailout.

Here\\'s what you need to know.\\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) â\\x80\\x94 Federal safety investigators intensified their scrutiny of a Monday fire aboard a Boeing 787 as concerned investors sold shares in the aircraft maker for a second day. Boeing on Tuesday confirmed that the fire aboard a Japan Airlines plane appeared to have started in a battery pack for the plane\\'s auxiliary power unit. The National Transportation Safety Board described the fire damage to the battery as \"severe,\" and said it is sending two more investigators to examine the Japan Airlines plane. It also formed investigative groups to look at the plane\\'s electrical systems as well as the fire response. Boeing has a lot riding on the 787. The long-range jet promises a smoother travel experience and is 20 percent more fuel efficient than older models. After years of delays, Boeing has now delivered 49 of the planes, with almost 800 more on order. The fire on Monday happened on the ground at Boston Logan International Airport, with no passengers on board. But in-flight fires can be catastrophic, so the matter is getting close scrutiny by aviation authorities. Interest is especially high in this fire because of indications that lithium batteries â\\x80\\x94 which generally have not been used on large planes before the 787 â\\x80\\x94 can burn very hot, with fires that are difficult to put out. The NTSB said it took firefighters 40 minutes to put out the fire near the back of the plane. JAL spokeswoman Carol Anderson said the airline inspected its 787s after the fire. She declined to discuss the results, but noted that no schedule changes were made as a result of the inspections. United Airlines said it inspected its six 787s overnight. A spokeswoman would not say what the inspections found. The Wall Street Journal reported that the inspections found an improperly installed bundle of wires connected to the same battery that burned on the on the JAL plane. Electrical problems have been the 787\\'s nemesis. Last month, a United Airlines 787 flying from Houston to Newark, N.J., diverted to New Orleans because of an electrical problem with a power distribution panel. Last week, United said it would delay the start of 787 flights from Houston to Lagos, Nigeria because it wanted to \"improve the reliability of the aircraft.\" In November 2010, a test flight had to make an emergency landing after an in-flight electrical fire. The fire delayed flight tests for several weeks while Boeing investigated. Boeing said the fire on Monday appears to be unrelated to previous electrical problems on the 787. \"Nothing that we\\'ve seen in this case indicates a relationship to any previous 787 power system events,\" Boeing said in a prepared statement. Those earlier problems involved power panels elsewhere in a rear bay for electrical equipment. Boeing also said it \"would be premature to discuss additional details at this stage\" of the investigation. Boeing said it has shared information about the prior events with the NTSB. Shares of Chicago-based Boeing have fallen 4.6 percent since the fire was reported, wiping out almost $2.7 billion of the company\\'s value. On Tuesday they fell $2, or 2.6 percent, to close at $74.13. Investors may have been unnerved by the fire after it appeared that the mechanical and manufacturing kinks with the 787 had been worked out. They may have also reacted to another 787 issue on Tuesday. A different Japan Airlines 787 at Logan had to be towed back to the gate after spilling 40 gallons of jet fuel. The flight was re-scheduled for later in the day. Copyright (2013) Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Given the political progress has made in shedding the Berlusconi era (to some extent) this election is being watched with some trepidation to see if Italy slides in one direction or another. According to a note from Morgan Stanley\\'s Daniele Antonucci, there seems to be pretty solid support for a Center-Left coalition. Peter Luigi Bersani would hold a comfortable lead over the coalition associated with Silvio Berlusconi. An interesting part of the note is where Antonucci discusses the \"Ohio\" of Italy: The Senate battleground\\x85 Out of 315 assigned seats, the regions with the highest number are Lombardy (49) and Lazio (28), where regional elections will be held in February, as well as the southern regions of Campania (29) and Sicily (25), and the northern region of Veneto (24), traditionally a North League stronghold \\x96 which has formalised a coalition with Silvio Berlusconi\\x92s PdL. The Senate, therefore, is the chamber of parliament in which the vote is more uncertain, partly because of the way the election law has been designed (i.e., a majority premium is assigned on a regional basis) and partly because of the PdL-North League coalition, which might win votes in Veneto and other northern regions. \\x85and \\x91Italy\\x92s Ohio\\x92: Lombardy, by far Italy\\x92s biggest region in terms of assigned seats in the Senate, is the region to watch. Faring well there might be so decisive for the election that some commentators are comparing it with Ohio in the US recent elections. But Lombardy\\x92s economy also accounts for about 20% of Italy\\x92s GDP. As such, one might also compare it with California, from an economic standpoint. Even though there aren\\x92t specific polls on Italy\\x92s Senate, the regional polls might help us gauge the political situation. While we keep monitoring it, at this stage, there\\x92s no single party/coalition with a clear lead.\\nJan. 9 (Bloomberg) -- American International Group Inc. said it has a duty to weigh joining a suit by former Chief Executive Officer Maurice â\\x80\\x9cHankâ\\x80\\x9d Greenberg that claims the insurerâ\\x80\\x99s 2008 U.S. bailout was unconstitutional. â\\x80\\x9cThe board of directors has fiduciary and legal obligations to the company and its shareholders to consider the demand served on us,â\\x80\\x9d CEO Robert Benmosche said yesterday in a statement. The board is scheduled to meet today to hear arguments from representatives of Greenberg and the U.S. Lawmakers including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Robert Menendez and Representative Peter Welch said New York-based AIG shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t join the suit. â\\x80\\x9cTaxpayers are still furious that they rescued a company whose own conduct brought it down,â\\x80\\x9d Welch said in a letter to AIG Chairman Steve Miller. â\\x80\\x9cDonâ\\x80\\x99t rub salt in the wounds with yet another reckless decision.â\\x80\\x9d Greenbergâ\\x80\\x99s investment firm Starr International Co., an AIG shareholder, filed the suit in 2011. Starr claims the rescue cheated investors by diluting their stakes. AIG accepted a rescue that swelled in value to $182.3 billion after it couldnâ\\x80\\x99t raise money in equity and bond markets to pay clients who bought protection against losses on mortgage- related securities. Greenberg is pursuing some of his claims in AIGâ\\x80\\x99s name, and the insurer has three options to respond, according to yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s statement. It can take over those claims and litigate them itself, allow Greenberg to prosecute them on its behalf, or prevent him from prosecuting the claims. Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0 Greenberg is likely to challenge a decision blocking him from proceeding, AIG said in the statement, which came after the New York Times reported on the case. â\\x80\\x9cIt is the AIG boardâ\\x80\\x99s obligation and intention to consider seriously Starrâ\\x80\\x99s demand and respond to it in a manner that the board believes is in the best interest of the company,â\\x80\\x9d AIG said. The board will review presentations by the U.S. Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Starr as directors work toward a decision by the end of this month. Suing the U.S. could present a public-relations challenge for the insurer, which has been running ads thanking taxpayers after repaying the bailout, which included funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, last year. â\\x80\\x9cAIG has paid back its debt to America with a profit, and we mean it when we say thank you to the American people,â\\x80\\x9d Benmosche said in yesterdayâ\\x80\\x99s statement. Â\\xa0 Â\\xa0 Joe Courtney, a Democratic congressman from Connecticut, mentioned the latest advertising push as he took to Twitter Inc.â\\x80\\x99s website yesterday to rebuke AIG for weighing the suit. â\\x80\\x9cAIG ads thanking America ring hollow,â\\x80\\x9d he wrote. â\\x80\\x9cChoice was TARP or bankruptcy. Suit is garbage.â\\x80\\x9d Greenberg won a federal judgeâ\\x80\\x99s approval to proceed with the case against in July. In the complaint, Starr said the government paid $500,000 for an AIG stake that was worth $25 billion, violating the constitutional rights of shareholders to due process and equal protection of the law. A parallel case against the New York Fed was dismissed in November. The case is Starr International Co. v.

For one thing, headlines out of Washington are dominating the discussion, and that\\'s unfortunate. Trading ranges have been very narrow. Traders have been talking about giant asteroids more than anything else. We might be looking at what a post-crisis environment might be like. Modest moves. Few notable headlines. Boredom. In his morning note, SocGen\\'s Kit Juckes tries to fight through the boredom, and come up with a few datapoints that he puts together to help reveal what\\'s really going on. The title of his note is: Patience... I need patience... The FT headline is that US oil imports are tumbling. the consumer credit data show credit demand is up, which is either bad (debt super-cycle alive and well) or good (animal spirits alive and well). But ALL the data suggest (to me, anyway) that the drag on Q1 activity in the US will be less than folks expect and that as that feeds through, we will see continued \\'risk on\\' behavior through Q1. ... Recent European data have pointed to a soft Q4 and a rebound of sorts in Q1. James Nixon concludes in this morning\\'s Economics piece, that the ECB is on hold for the foreseeable future. At the margin, improving sentiment about Q1 should underpin the Euro, and with peripheral spreads tighter, our models continue to show that the Euro is 1) higher than it should be and 2) facing no pressure to correct downwards. It\\'s nothing major, but at the margins things keep getting better. European data hasn\\'t been that horrible. US is hanging in better than people might have expected, especially given the confidence shocks. Mostly though, people are waiting for something to happen.\\nIt\\'s very exciting to see more people talking about and taking seriously the idea of minting a trillion dollar platinum coin in order to circumvent the debt ceiling, and avoid being dragged down in other economically costly standoff. Pretty much every media organization has now done something on it, although the quality of the reporting has been uneven. Probably the worst mistake that gets frequently made is seen in this headline from the Christian Science Monitor (which is by no means alone): Is a $1 trillion coin the solution to the debt crisis? There is nobody suggesting that the trillion dollar coin be a solution to the \"debt crisis,\" whatever that means. This has nothing to do with the US paying back its national debt. The idea of having the Treasury mint a trillion dollar coin is simply a technical way of addressing the debt ceiling, putting a coin at its bank account at the Fed, so that it doesn\\'t miss any obligation payments, in the event that Congress doesn\\'t raise the legal limit on borrowing. This may seem like a silly quibble, but it\\'s actually incredibly important, since one of the biggest failures of media, in general, has been to not explain to people what the \"debt ceiling\" is very well. As it is, the majority of Americans tell pollsters that they don\\'t favor raising the debt ceiling, a position they would be unlikely to take if they new the consequences of that. But it\\'s understandable why they say this: They think the debt ceiling has something to do with accumulating national debt, rather than just authorizing payments made on promises that have already been made. So in this trillion dollar coin campaign, we\\'re seeing it again, the media failing to draw a distinction between the coin being used to circumvent the debt ceiling, and the coin being used to pay down the debt (which its not).

      "Taxes increased for almost all Americans at midnight last night. Since then, half of the American government, the Senate, approved a bill that would cut taxes for many of those Americans. The bill has been sent to the other half of the American government, the House of Representatives, so it can be signed into law. But Republicans in the House of Representatives are disgruntled about the Fiscal Cliff bill the Senate approved and are threatening not to approve it. The Senate bill calls for massive tax cuts for most Americans, including the investor and owner class (dividend taxes will be much lower under the Senate bill than they are under the law that took effect last night). This puts the Republicans in an odd position, considering that the party's primary mission is to cut taxes: Taxes have already gone up. So the Republicans are now the only thing standing between America and a gigantic tax cut. SEE ALSO: Great News For Romney Voters -- Congress Just Socked It To The 47%\n",
      "The Senate has approved a tax deal to blunt some of the impact of the Fiscal Cliff. There's some great news for the investor and owner class in there: Dividend taxes won't go up anywhere near as much as they would have with no deal. And income taxes will only rise for households making a healthy $450,000 or more--and, even then, not very much (just back to the Clinton-era 39.6%). And there's other excellent news for those who regard America as a land of \"makers\" and \"takers.\" Congress just socked it to Mitt Romney's famous 47%. Remember \"the 47%\"? They're the Americans who Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said \"don't take responsibility for themselves,\" because they make too little money to pay income taxes. (How dare they not make enough money to pay income taxes! How irresponsible and rude!) Of course, as many appalled Americans pointed out in the wake of Romney's remarks, most of these folks are either seniors collecting Social Security or working Americans who make less than ~$50,000 a year. And most of the latter folks pay payroll taxes and other taxes, like sales taxes. But these folks are still held in low regard by those who consider themselves America's makers. So there's great news for these folks tucked into the Senate bill: By not extending the payroll tax cuts, the Senate agreed to raise payroll taxes on working Americans from 4.2% to 6.2%--a tax that will apply to the first $113,000 of earned income. This tax increase will hit anyone who earns money in this country, including \"the 47%.\" So, it's almost like Romney got elected! SEE ALSO: DEAR AMERICA: Here Are Your New Tax Rates\n",

      "Venture capitalist Fred Wilson, of Union Square Ventures, has helped his firm post some of the best returns in the entire VC industry over the past five years. The firm's performance has been nothing short of spectacular, and Fred Wilson's reputation has justifiably soared. And yet, in 2012, even though USV had some amazing exits that coined money for the firm, its partners, and its clients, Wilson said in a recent blog post that he feels like it was a \"shitty year.\" Why? Because Wilson did not make a single investment in 2012. In fact, Wilson has not made a single investment since the summer of 2011--more than 18 months ago. For a firm that has made dozens of investments over the last five years, and has been on a tremendous roll, that is highly unusual. Usually, when firms and investors get on a hot streak, the partners get giddier and more aggressive as the streak continues. They begin to feel like they're playing with \"house money,\" boatloads of it, and they start throwing that money at whatever strikes their fancy. They also feel pressure to continue to justify their reputations (and fees), and keep the momentum going. So when they're not making investments, they feel like they're \"doing nothing\"--resting on laurels based on past accomplishments having nothing do to with what they are doing right now. And yet, for those who have been around long enough to understand the ebb and flow of investment cycles, it is clear that \"doing nothing\" is often the smartest investment decision of all. Every great investment opportunity goes through this investment cycle. In the beginning, when the opportunity is truly \"speculative\"--when most people think investing in the opportunity is obviously stupid--a few brave souls make brave bets and then cash in on extraordinary early returns. Then, everyone else sees those returns, and the money rushes in. Soon, all the investment money bids up prices and creates a wave of competitors vying for the same opportunity, and investment returns begin to drop. Eventually, the \"fools\" rush in, bidding prices up to truly silly levels, and dozens of competitors fight over the tiny crumbs of opportunity left on the table. Then returns collapse and the cycle ends. The consumer Internet cycle that drove Union Square Ventures' returns over the past 5-7 years began to wind down a year or two ago. So many investors had jumped into the game, so many companies were attacking the opportunity, and valuations had gotten so high that expected returns for small startups had begun to drop. There was massive excitement in the sector, of course--and huge \"buzz\" (in part because so many people were in the game)--but the fundamentals were no longer attractive. So the smartest investors began to scale back and look elsewhere. Or, in the case of Union Square, they just began to say \"no.\" It's hard to imagine how many serious business plans and opportunities Union Square has said \"no\" to over the past 18 months. If I had to guess, I'd say it was on the order of 10 per day, or about 500 over the period. And that's just the serious ones. Saying \"no\" when the rest of the industry (and your competitors) are in a feeding frenzy is difficult. You often look and feel like an idiot. No matter how confident you are that the cycle has played out, you know that you might be wrong, and that you'll end up with your reputation in tatters, looking like a fool. So saying \"no\" is extremely hard to do. But, in investing, it's occasionally the smartest thing to do. So, even though Fred Wilson feels like he had a \"shitty year\" in 2012 because he didn't make any new investments, it's possible (likely, even) that he will end up having had a much better year than almost every other VC in the industry. In other words, Wilson may have demonstrated again that the performance Union Square has delivered over the past 5 years is no fluke and that he and his partners Brad Burnham and Albert Wenger deserve their reputations as one of the most talented investment teams in the industry.

      "It's assumed that the House will pass the Fiscal Cliff bill that the Senate passed last night, but until the last votes are taken, nothing is guaranteed. While liberals were seen as the huge source of concern yesterday, in the House, the big challenge is for Boehner to bring the votes. A lot of conservatives hate the bill. Tea Party representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeted his opposition:  That partially echoes the sentiment of Marro Rubio, one of just 8 Senators who voted 'NO' last night. In a statement he said: âThousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they'll pay this new tax and, chances are, they'll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hire they were looking to make. And to make matters worse, it does nothing to bring our dangerous debt under control.\" And here's what Heritage Action said last night, when it urged politicians to vote NO. This kick-the-can approach, necessitated by a president who refuses to stop campaigning and start seriously addressing our nationâs fiscal problems, is not an adequate solution to Americaâs coming fiscal crisis, which is a result ofÂ overspending, not under-taxing.Â  Allowing a tax increase to hit a certain segment of Americans and small businesses is not a solution; when combined with the coming Obamacare tax increases, it all but ensures a weaker economy. ... Regardless of those provisions, it is clear that Washington continues to fail the American people.Â  America needs less spending, less taxing and less borrowing by our government, which would allow more investment and job-creation by Americaâs private sector economy. To date, President Obama hasÂ proven to be fundamentally unseriousÂ about tackling our nationâs coming fiscal crisis. Â America needs real leaders proposing real solutions, such as those found in HeritageâsÂ Saving the American DreamÂ plan or even the previous House-passed budget.Â  This kick-the-can approach falls woefully short. Heritage Action opposes the kick-the-can tax increase and will include it as a key vote on our legislative scorecard. So basically, conservatives want spending cuts NOW, and this bill doesn't deliver. That being said, if the bill gets killed, taxes rise for everyone, and there's still no new spending cuts. \n",
      "Most of the attention around the Fiscal Cliff has been focused on income taxes. The way the deal went down, a tiny portion of American taxpayers â households that earn more than $450,000 per year â will see their income taxes rise modestly, from 35% to 39.6%. Everyone else's income taxes will stay the same. But that's not the whole story. By not addressing the payroll tax, the Fiscal Cliff deal will also result in a tax hike for all working Americans, including those in the middle and poor classes. All income up to $110,000 will now be socked with a 2 point increase in the payroll tax, from 4.2% to 6.2%, which will pluck $2,000 out of the pockets of families making $100,000 a year. Meanwhile, thanks to a deal on dividend taxes, the highest earning Americans have gotten a massive tax cut over the taxes that would have taken effect had a Fiscal Cliff deal not been agreed to. Dividend taxes for households making more than $450,000 per year will rise from 15% to 20% (plus an additional 3.8% surcharge for Obamacare, to a total of 23.8%). But they won't rise all the way to 39.6%, which they were scheduled to rise to without a Fiscal Cliff deal. Meanwhile, dividend taxes for those earning less than $450,000 a year will remain at 15% (18.8% with the surcharge, for those with income between $250,000 and $450,000). So the richest Americans have dodged a big tax bullet. Importantly, the dividend tax deal will disproportionately help the richest Americans: In other words, the tax deal that Congress just agreed to will raise $125 billion from increased payroll taxes from all working Americans (poor and middle class alike), while saving the richest Americans at least $20 billion in dividend taxes. Some of the folks who will save money on dividend taxes will obviously pay more on wage income, so there will be some balancing. But some won't. So, be happy this morning, rich Americans! This is a great deal for you! SEE ALSO: DEAR AMERICA: Here Are Your New Tax Rates\n",
      "Assuming the House agrees to what the Senate voted on last night, then the Bush-era tax cuts will be made permanent for almost all Americans. Only those with incomes of $400K and up will see an income tax increase. But the other half of the Fiscal Cliff, the sequester (the mandatorys pending cuts agreed to in the debt ceiling fight) has only been delayed, giving DC more time to fight over it. That means we've already scheduled a new Fiscal Cliff, and the bill agreed to last night has the date: March 1, 2013 (exactly two months from today). This is from page 154 of the bill (HT: @jesse_livermore)  What will be interesting timing-wise is when the Treasury says we will hit the hard debt ceiling. The next two months will be non-stop debt ceiling/sequester, and it will all come to a head in late February/early March. For more on what's in the 157-page bill, see here &gt;\n",
      "On January 1, just before 2 AM, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to pass a bill that will avert the Fiscal Cliff. The House approved it later that night. The bill is pretty straightforward. Income tax rates will only rise on those making over $400K (liberals wanted $250K, GOP wanted no taxes to rise). Spending cuts will be delayed for 2 months to give the sides more time to address them. So why is the bill 157-pages long? Because when Washington does business and passes a huge bill, there are all kinds of little other pre-existing tax things most Americans have never heard of, but which needed to be extended, that also get into the bill. It's just how it works.       Some might think this is nefarious  that politicians see a huge bill and then sneak in all these random things. The reality is more like these have been around for a while, and every time a big bill comes up about taxes expiring, they get extended too. For the full text of the bill, see here &gt;\n",
      "Brendan Hoffman/Getty ImagesToday the Fiscal Cliff debate moves to the House of Representatives. The Senate overwhelmingly passed the deal late last night (around 2 AM). While passage is expected in The House, there is A LOT of conservative frustration with the fact that A) taxes are going up B) basically nothing is done on the spending side. So there are a lot of folks hwo hate the bill. On the flipside, killing the bill by voting NO would be a political disaster. So what might happen? Citi's Steven Englander breaks down the three scenarios: 1)     A close vote before 6PM  Asian markets open up, catching up to the Monday S&amp;P move; S&amp;P futures probably have priced in most of the benefit of the fiscal cliff resolution. EUR CAD, and AUD have a bit of catching up to do with the S&amp;P, but there should be little drama  2)     A rancorous debate that extends into the night  again the key will be whether the votes are there, however, reluctantly, but if it looks as if support is waning we will see sharp moves in markets. With brinkmanship the new normal, the sell-off will be partial on the view that a last minute rabbit will be pulled from a hat.  3)     Amendments or rejection  markets will sell off sharply.  If it turns out that the House cant vote yes on an acceptable, yet inelegant fix, the confidence that has emerged in 11th hour fixes will dissipate and tail risk scenarios will shift into baseline outcomes. This would be USDJPY negative,  but risk-correlated currencies now price in 80-90% probably of a successful fix in our view, so the downside pressures will be large.

      "The Wall Street Journal has a big scare-story about analysts at big banks and their Facebook stock ratings. Despite the fact that Facebook's stock tanked once it hit the public markets, Wall Street analysts have largely issued \"buy\" recommendations for the stock. This is a problem, says the Journal because: What some see as the relentless \"buy, buy, buy\" optimism has deepened skepticism about the Wall Street stock-pitching machine. Critics say Facebook is a telling example of the divided loyalties at many firms, which woo lucrative investment-banking clients and then prod brokerage customers to buy the same stocks even if they look bruised. This is a very familiar, and very old story. But this time, it doesn't really ring true. You see, when the banks that underwrote Facebook's IPO started putting out their recommendations on the stock, they weren't exactly glowing. Morgan Stanley, for instance, had a price target of $38 on the stock in its first research report. The IPO price was $38. That means Morgan Stanley's analysts said any big institutional investor that bought the stock at $38 wasn't going to see a gain on the investment in the next twelve months. We're not exactly certain how this could be construed as some shady deal by Morgan Stanley to sucker people into buying Facebook stock. Other analysts with buy recommendations on Facebook also have price targets right around $38, which is an insult to the people that paid the IPO price. If there really was some grand conspiracy on the part of Facebook's bankers to push off Facebook stock, the price targets would be much higher. The Journal also seems to be unhappy that even as banks lowered their price targets by a few dollars they maintained their buy ratings. This is just how it goes with sell-side analysts. Look at Apple. The price targets went way up, and have come way down, but overall, it's still rated a \"buy.\" Investors can't go on just buy or sell ratings. They need to read the reports and make up their minds. Also, maybe, just maybe, analysts actually think Facebook is going to go back to $40 a share. After all, it's a company with 1 billion users and a big opportunity to monetize its mobile application, something it hasn't yet done. It also has a chance to develop a new ad network. Big smart investors bought the stock at $38 a share for the IPO, which suggests they thought it was going to pop higher. This suggests that analysts who have twelve month price targets of $40 or more aren't all that crazy or engaged in some sort of side dealing. They just think the stock is currently undervalued.\n",

There's a reason, however, why the best bridge players in the country are almost all investors. Business Insider deputy editor and bridge enthusiast Gus Lubin notes: \"Bridge is a complex card game that fits the analytic side of finance, as poker appeals to instincts.\" A bridge devotee, Warren Buffett has famously declared, \"I wouldn't mind going to jail if I had three cellmates who played bridge.\" But passion for the game has gotten some on Wall Street in trouble. As recounted in William D. Cohan's House of Cards, Jimmy Cayne played a tournament of bridge while Bear Sterns imploded, an example of antipathy at the executive level that is often compared to Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burned. Though an intense mental activity, bridge also offers an opportunity to unwind for high-octane individuals. A 1955 issue of Sports Illustrated references Eisenhower's love for the game which was his \"only effective form of relaxation...The most relaxing thing he could do was to play a game in which the problems were tough, the solutions difficult, but the consequences of error were just a few hundred harmless points written down on a scorepad.\" There's no doubt why investors still flock to this challenging test of teamwork, memory, and wits.

      "We are 13 years into a secular bear market in the United States. The Nasdaq is still down 40% from its high, and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are essentially flat. European and Japanese equities have generally fared worse.             The average secular bear market in the US has been about 11 years, with the shortest to date being four years and the longest 20. Are we at the beginning of a new bull market or another seven years of famine? What sorts of returns should we expect over the coming years from US equities?             Even if you have no investments in the stock market, this is an important question, in part because the pensions funded by state and local governments are heavily invested in US equities. In fact, they are often projecting returns in excess of 10% per year. How likely is that to happen? Who will make up the difference if it doesnt? In nearly all states and jurisdictions, it is against the law to change the terms of a public pension plan once it is agreed upon.             Even more important to you personally, what will happen to your taxes if the secular bear persists? On this final day of 2012, lets take a look at the potential returns of the stock market over the next 7-10 years. In previous Thoughts from the Frontline and in my book Bulls Eye Investing, I have written that stock market returns are a function of valuations (typically, price-to-earnings ratios). Secular bull markets are periods of rising valuations, while secular bear markets are periods of falling valuations. While stock market returns can vary widely over one-year, ten-year, or twenty-year periods, over the long term stock market earnings have tended to correlate very highly with GDP and inflation.             Since GDP has tended to grow (at least until recently) at 3% per year, predicting long-term returns and secular bull and bear markets has been pretty straightforward. But recently several noteworthy analysts have presented research suggesting that GDP will not grow anywhere close to 3% over the coming decades. In todays letter we look at the ramifications of slower GDP growth on equity returns. For most investors this is a very important topic, as the stock market tends to be the main driver of their investment returns.             At the beginning of the last decade I wrote that the US economy would be lucky to grow at 2% for the entire decade. Even though I was called a big bad bear at the time, it turns out that I was an optimist. The economy grew at 1.7%. When asked about the present decade a few years ago, I cautiously said that we would be lucky to grow at 2% for the decade, which elicited more bearish name-calling. Now I once again find myself to be more optimistic than some of my colleagues.             Last summer Bill Gross (chief investment officer of PIMCO) forecast that the US economy would grow at only 1.5% over the next decade. Recently, Jeremy Grantham of GMO (one of my investment heroes) wrote a paper called On the Road to Zero Growth, in which he forecast that Going forward, GDP growth (conventionally measured) for the U.S. is likely to be about only 1.4% a year, and adjusted growth about 0.9%.             Adding further to the sentiment, Dr. Robert Gordon, a very respected economist, wrote a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research provocatively titled Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds. Quoting from the abstract: Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative exercise in subtraction suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades.             Even if Gordon does measure growth somewhat unconventionally, his is a very sobering forecast.             Finally, we have a paper called 1%... The New Normal Growth Rate? Authored by Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates (the firm founded by my friend Rob Arnott), it presents their view that 1% is the new normal growth rate. Chris follows up on research presented earlier, in which they described what they call the 3-D Hurricane of deficits, debt, and demography.             My good friend (and no stranger to longtime readers of this letter) Ed Easterling of Crestmont Research (full bio at the end of this letter) and I were recently discussing these forecasts, finding humor in the fact that Grantham and Brightman, et al. were essentially calling Gross an optimist. But we definitely did not find anything funny about the implications of their forecasts on long-term stock market returns. We thereupon agreed to coauthor this letter, with the intention of helping you make your investment plans for the coming year. As we have done in the past, Ed wrote the first draft and I threw in a little editing and commenting, trying not to diminish the value of his research. And with that setup, lets jump right in. (Note: All graphs and charts are his.)             As noted above, the longer-term assessments for GDP growth are turning decidedly lower than the long-term 3% we saw over the last century. Our purpose in this letter is to look beyond the details of each argument as to the prospects for growth. That is, our objective is to understand the long-term implications of growth for stock market returns. Whether your favorite economist foresees 2%, 1%, or 0% long-term growth, the outcome for returns is similar in direction: the impact will lie somewhere between bad and worse.             The following discussion includes excerpts from Eds book Probable Outcomes (and its one I highly recommend  John). It explores the possibility that future real economic growth may have downshifted from its historical trend of 3%  and more significantly, it highlights the implications of that shift.             Historically, the prospect of slower economic growth has not often been considered by economists and analysts, but it now looms large in mainstream thinking. The effects of slower growth on stock market returns will be dramatic for investors. Shifts &amp; Cycles             Most investors recognize that the stock market delivers extended periods of above-average and below-average returns. These periods are known as secular stock-market cycles. The last full secular bear was 1966-1981. The most recent secular bull ran from 1982-1999. Our current secular bear market started in 2000, and it still has a long way to go. Figure 1 presents all secular stock market periods since 1900. Figure 1. Secular Stock Market Cycles Mauldin            These secular periods are not the result of a random walk through good times and bad times. They are not periods of war or peace. They are not even alternating periods of recession and expansion in the economy. Rather, secular stock-market cycles are driven by changes in the overall value of the market. In other words, secular bull markets are periods when the price/earnings ratio (P/E) of the market rises and compounds returns, while secular bear markets are periods when P/E declines and compromises returns. The blue line near the bottom of Figure 1 shows the history of P/E. Rising P/E drives secular bulls (green-bar periods), and declining P/E drives secular bears (red-bar periods).             Most important, the P/E cycle is not a coincidental wave nor a random walk. P/E is driven by the trend and level of the inflation rate. Higher inflation drives interest rates upward. Investors demand higher returns to offset the adverse impact of inflation. Thus, higher inflation drives P/E lower, so stock-market investors can achieve higher returns from lower prices and higher dividend yields.             Deflation also drives P/E lower. That occurs in response to an expected future of declining nominal earnings and dividends. And declining nominal cash flows during deflation drives current values lower.             Therefore, for more than a century, stock-market investors have endured secular stock-market cycles driven by the inflation-rate cycle. But there is a second variable that determines stock-market valuation. Until recently, that variable could be ignored because it was accepted as a constant. Over the decades, this second variable has seemed to crawl along like the notorious tortoise.             The second variable impacting stock-market value is the growth rate of earnings. Investors know that high-growth companies have higher P/Es than slower-growing, mature companies. The same principle applies to the market overall. It is especially relevant now that the constant of economic growth is uncertain.             During the past century, real economic growth increased at an average of slightly more than 3% annually. As a result of the strong relationship between earnings and the economy, earnings per share (EPS) for the major stock market indexes also increased at near 3% in real terms.             (This makes sense, because how can very broad market indexes grow any faster than the overall economy? Individual companies and industries can, of course, grow faster or slower; but the average is highly correlated with GDP growth plus inflation.  John)             P/E generally peaked in the mid-20s (except during the Great Bubble of the late 1990s) and troughed below 10. The outside range for P/E, as well as its midpoint average near 15.5, occurred with such consistency because the growth rates of both the economy and earnings were so consistent over the long term, at close to 3%.             In effect, the growth rate determines the P/E range and midpoint, and the inflation rate determines the location and trend within the range. A change in growth rate causes a shift in the range. These two dynamics are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin              One effect of slower economic and earnings growth will be a lower level of earnings in the future. For example, over ten years, $1.00 compounds to $1.34 at 3%, but to only $1.22 at 2%. The difference is about 9.3% less EPS for the stock market under the slower growth scenario. Many analysts would consider that level of variance a minor forecasting error for EPS over a decade. Whether the stock market is 9% higher or lower in a decade is generally small change in the context of overall returns. But the implication of slower growth is far more significant than simply the ending level of earnings  slower growth is a game-changer.             There are three ways to assess the effects of slower growth, all of which provide similar results. First, an extremely long-term model of earnings growth, dividend payouts, and present value can be constructed to assess the impact of changes in growth on P/E. Second, academic formulas can be employed to derive the effects on P/E based upon perpetual dividend growth. Third, the impact on P/E can be evaluated through the components of stock-market returns. Since all three approaches reflect comparable results, the more pragmatic third approach will be used here to explore the implications.             Before examining the details, consider the significance of the issue. If the future growth rate of earnings decreases by 1% (i.e., near the reduction that would be expected if economic growth decreases by 1%), the historical average for P/E would decline from 15.5 to 11.5 amounting to a 26% decline in the stock market beyond the 9% shortfall from lower earnings growth. Even more dramatically, the typical peak in P/E would fall from the low to mid 20s to the mid-teens  the adverse impact of slower growth increases at higher levels of P/E. (This is explained in further detail below.)             As discussed above, inflation causes P/E to decrease because investors demand higher returns in compensation. Unlike the inflation rate, though, the growth rate of earnings does not necessarily change the return level that investors expect. They will still expect returns that are commensurate with the stock market and the expected inflation rate, but they will look to replace the contribution of slower earnings growth with another source of return.             To illustrate, assuming that a change in the growth rate does not change the inflation rate, the yields on government bonds can be expected to remain the same. Absent a change in credit quality from slower growth, the risk premium for corporate bond yields will not change. Likewise, the expected return from stock-market investments can be expected to remain unchanged due to the growth rate.             When slower growth reduces the contribution of earnings growth to total return, another source of return is therefore needed to make up the shortfall. Stock-market investors are not willing to take equity risk without appropriate equity returns. If bond yields do not change, they will not compromise stock-market returns. In this situation, stock-market investors will step away until the price of the market declines until it again provides adequate returns. This is the function of markets: finding the price that provides a fair return.             This discussion relates to the effect from changes in the growth rate of earnings. To isolate that factor, several assumptions are needed, basically providing that the relevant relationships remain the same. First, based upon the previous economics discussion, a downshift in economic growth drives slower earnings growth. Second, long-term profit margins remain similar under both growth scenarios; thus the slowing of earnings growth is consistent with the downshift in economic growth. Third, the inflation rate remains constant across both scenarios for growth. Fourth, the expected return for stocks and bonds as well as the related equity risk premium for stocks does not change across both scenarios for growth. In other words, the relevant relationships remain constant.             Of the three components of stock-market returns, two are available as sources of return, and the third one represents the way in which returns occur. The first source of return, EPS growth, is defined in this example as providing either 3% or 2% toward to the total return (Historical Growth and Slower Growth bars in Figure 2). As a result, the second source of return, dividend yield, will need to increase to compensate for lower earnings growth in the slower-growth scenario. Herein lies the role of the third source of stock-market returns: changes in P/E.             The dividend yield rises as P/E declines, and vice versa. For the stock market to be positioned to provide equity-level returns, investors will look for the lower price that enables the dividend yield to rise sufficiently to offset the loss of earnings growth. The required decline in P/E varies based upon the starting level of P/E.             If P/E starts relatively high, then a higher decline is required to provide the required dividend yield increase. For example, if EPS growth drops by 1%, then the change in P/E required to increase the dividend yield by 1% is 7 points (from 22 to 15), 4 points (from 15.5 to 11.5), and 2 points (from 10 to 8).             This shift in P/E relates only to the change in earnings growth. P/E would then be further affected by changes in the inflation rate. Figure 3 provides another graphic illustration of the dynamics of the shift and growth cycles. The shift is related to changes in growth rate, and the cycle is driven by inflation-rate trends and levels. Figure 3. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin As previously mentioned, the two other methodologies provide similar results. A change in the forecast for future earnings due to slower growth results in lower present values. Likewise, the reduction in the growth-rate variable in traditional academic models also produces lower current values.             Well, what about Bill Gross future of 1.5% growth, Chris Brightmans outlook for 1% growth, and Jeremy Granthams ultimate rate of 0.4% growth? Two-percent growth downshifts the future average P/E from 15.5 to 11.5. If that is not concerning enough, note that a one-percent growth rate resets the long-term average P/E to near 9.             At this point in time, there is a significant disconnect between the markets expectation of future growth and the vision of these notable sages. P/E, normalized for the business cycle, is near 20. That is consistent with the current low inflation rate and historical average growth rates. Should it become apparent that either factor might change, beware the adverse impact of another P/E cycle, a new era with P/E shifting downward, or the compounded effects of both concurrently.             There will likely be, and needs to be, much debate about the accuracy of the estimates presented above, and about nuances that could add decimal points to the factors or adjust the effects based upon further scenario assumptions. However, whether using long-term models, academic formulas, or the component-based method, all three approaches provide similar results. It is therefore important to recognize that slower growth will have a significant impact on P/E at all levels of the inflation rate. As the discussion evolves into implications and probable outcomes over this decade, slower economic and earnings growth will have a direct effect on the P/E range.             We are frequently asked how we expect lower valuations to manifest themselves. The single-digit P/E ratios that are typical of the end of a secular bear market and the beginning of a secular bull market would mean either a significant drop in the current valuation of the stock market or a prolonged sideways market. A general awareness and acceptance of a slower-growth economy would certainly help bring about lower valuations.             Investors are confronting the reality of the current secular bear market, which is both a consequence of the previous secular bull market and a precursor to the next secular bull. The duration of the current secular bear period is uncertain. Should higher inflation or deflation overcome the currently rather stable inflation regime in the near term, this secular bear could end sooner, as that would drive valuations down. That outcome, however, would cause significant losses to stock market portfolios. If, however, inflation or deflation slowly creeps into the economy  over the next decade, for example  then this secular bear will be one of the longer ones. However, if this decade repeats the relatively low inflation of the past decade, then the secular bear may linger longer than any of us would like.             Beyond the inflation rate, economic growth will also have an impact on the future of this secular bear. Following last decades below-average economic growth, if we are to return to the 3% historic growth trend, then this decade must soon start to generate above-average growth to offset the recent shortfall. The result would be a solid boost to earnings in this decade. However, economic growth could also have downshifted during the last decade to a lower level that will persist for the foreseeable future. The result would be a significantly lower range of P/Es, but not necessarily a progression through and out of the secular bear market. The economic growth rate can shift P/E upward or downward, but only inflation or deflation can kill a secular bear.             Whether this secular bear cycle ends in five years, ten years, or beyond, the ultimate outcome will be the start of the next secular bull market, which will bring an extended period of above-average returns. Spring will finally have sprung. There is a rainbow out there somewhere. This longer-term view of secular stock market cycles lets us look out across this secular bear to the next secular bull. The operative word is across this secular bear and not past it.             Across recognizes the reality of the risks and opportunities presented by the secular bear in whose grip we find ourselves. Past suggests the ostrich-like approach of ignoring reality in the blind hope of an unrealistic outcome. Across is enabling, while past is disabling.             For investors who are accumulating for the future, secular bear markets are times to build savings for later investment. This is done not only through contributions but also through prudent investing by means of an absolute-return approach. The absolute-return approach uses the dual strategy of risk management and investment selection.             Investment portfolios should be diversified across a range of investments that are diligently selected and actively managed, especially ones that control risk and enhance return. Investors should not avoid the stock market nor bond market altogether. Instead, their objective should be to seek, in both markets, investments that incorporate elements of skill to enhance returns. Secular bear markets are not periods during which to avoid investing; they are periods that demand an adjustment to investment strategy as well as to expectations regarding what potential returns can be.             For investors in pension funds and retirees who are more dependent on their current assets, early recognition is key to the investment strategy. The principles of absolute-return investing are important for preserving capital and generating much-needed returns; but it is potentially even more important for these investors to manage their assumptions and expectations. Recognizing secular-bear market conditions earlier enables investors to make potentially painful adjustments more easily and with less damage. Delaying action until crisis has onset generally brings adverse consequences! Hoping that the next secular bull market will arrive quickly is not a prudent way to address shortfalls. The longer it takes you to adjust expectations, the greater the gap to you will have to fill and the shorter the time you will have to fill it.             This strategy applies most of all to those entrusted with the management of pensions, both private and public. The largest fraction of the monies a pension fund will pay out in the future is expected to come from investment growth. At the beginning of the last decade, pension funds were routinely expecting to get 8% or higher returns on their investment portfolios. Those projections have proved a dismal illusion. Yet pension funds continue to anticipate 7-8% returns going forward. The very people who should know best that past performance is not indicative of future results are expecting the stock market to return to past performance to give them their longed-for results.             These pension-fund shortfalls will mean higher required contributions from corporations. More important, and urgently, they also mean higher required funding for public pensions from taxpayers, accompanied by a reduction of promised benefits. We do not see how the state of Illinois, for example, can meet its obligations without a significant restructuring of its pension plans or its budget, or more likely both. While those receiving pensions would prefer higher taxes on those funding them, there is a limit to what taxpayers will bear.             Sadly, were going to find that this is not just an Illinois problem, but one that will become apparent in states, cities, and counties all across the country. This is going to cause a great deal of distress for everyone concerned.             Finally, a comment on GDP growth. The downbeat forecasts mentioned at the beginning of the letter are all based on different methodologies, and we will venture one further argument. It is highly likely that taxes are going to increase over the next few years, and not just due to the current fiscal cliff issue. No matter which path is chosen in the short term, it seems improbable that a true resolution to the total deficit issue will be accomplished. More deficit-reduction work will be needed. That means spending cuts, accompanied by yet more tax increases.             However you view the prospect of increased taxes, there is no way to get around the fact that they will reduce general savings. If you reduce savings you reduce the capital available for investment in current and future businesses. If you reduce capital formation, youre going to reduce future growth. The current fetish among the economic thought leaders is that consumption is the driver of GDP growth. But GDP growth is ultimately a reflection of increases in population and productivity. And if you want to increase productivity, you must increase capital available for investment.             Note that this is a circular argument. If we increase taxes, we reduce the potential for GDP growth by reducing the capital available for investment, which of course makes the rosy growth projections of government forecasters fall short, thus driving future deficits even higher, minus further deficit-reduction efforts. As Chris Brightman writes: The most important determinant of our productivity per person is the amount of capital we have available for investment, and wise use of that capital. Investing to improve productivity in all of its forms, from machine tools, to transportation infrastructure, to education, can all raise our productivity. Investing requires savings, and we have been saving far too little. To increase productivity requires that we reorient our economy away from debt-financed consumption and toward saving-financed investment.             The politicians in Washington all give lip service to the need for growth. But then they turn around and do the very things that make it more difficult for the economy to grow. And as we have seen, this is going to make it more difficult for the stock market to return to a secular bull path. Which will create a greater need for higher taxes and/or reduced spending on the state and local levels. Which of course hurts GDP growth.             We are coming to the Endgame. There are no easy solutions, only very difficult ones. And none of them bode well for future equity valuations.             John here: I can tell you that there is deep concern when Ed and I talk about the consequences of government actions and potentially slow GDP growth for the average investor. All too few people understand the links between government decisions and their retirement portfolios. If you are reading this letter, you are one of those few. You do have options, but there are no easy options any more.             For those interested in cycles I suggest you take a close look at Eds books, Unexpected Returns and Probable Outcomes, and his excellent website, www.Crestmontresearch.com. It is a treasure trove of knowledge. At the beginning of each year, Ed updates most of the websites charts and graphs, many of which were included in one or both of his books.             I also recently wrote a paper along these lines, published by my partners at Altegris, on its home page (to access it, first you must indicate what type of investor you are). My paper focuses on managed futures, and youll find other papers on alternative investments, along with a lot of worthwhile research Altegris has done. Alternative investing is increasingly a part of accepted investing methodology. In my opinion, alternatives should be defined broadly to mean not sitting back and depending on buy and hope (otherwise known as buy and hold) equity indexes. We will have reason to explore this topic further in the coming year!             You will likely be getting this letter on New Years Eve. Let me wish you a very happy and prosperous new year. Im going to begin the new year by flying to Santa Barbara to be with my friend and partner Jon Sundt of Altegris Investments at his home up at the Hollister Ranch. While we will spend some time, as we always do, talking about alternative investments and ways to make them more readily available to investors, I will spend the bulk of my time thinking about my annual forecast letter, which I will write this coming weekend. I spend more time researching this one letter than anything else I write, and this year will be no different.             Ill fly back on Saturday and then leave Sunday afternoon for Europe. Ill be there for over two weeks. The first portion of the trip, I will be in Scandinavia on a speaking tour for Skagen Funds. I am finalizing details for the remaining time, but I intend to go to Greece and then make a quick stop in Geneva. I really want to experience Greece firsthand, rather than just through the eyes of other writers.             I will fly to Toronto on Sunday, January 27 to spend some time with my friend David Rosenberg. He has recently returned from Jerusalem (or, as he wrote me, Yerushalayim), where he celebrated the bar mitzvah of his youngest son, Mikey. Mazel tov, young man. Then Ill meet with my longtime friend and natural-resource maven Rick Rule and the team at Sprott Asset Management. And that evening Ill do a speech for my Canadian partner, John Nicola of Nicola Wealth Management. (If you are interested in attending the speech, drop me a note and I will send it on to John N.) From Toronto, Ill probably move on to New York and DC.             Let me suggest that you spend a few moments with this most-excellent, if somewhat sad, video of the music of the great artists who graced our lives and passed away this year. I admit to having played it a few times. Thanks to each of them for the memories.             My daughter Amanda took it upon herself to decorate my home for Christmas this year. We went out and bought a tree right after Thanksgiving, and then she took over. I must admit, it was more festive in the house than I remember it ever being. And the tree was quite fragrant. Also, the family was around more, for whatever reason. They just seemed to want to be together more this year. It was a great time and I enjoyed being home with the kids and grandkids and having some time off from the road.             Yesterday, Amanda also ended up with the task of putting everything away. She up to my office, where I was, as usual, reading and writing. She had a sad look on her face. Dad, I hate putting up the Christmas stuff. Its so sad.             I made some lame comment about time passing and how much fun it had been and how she had made the house so beautiful. And then I looked in her eyes. I did not see what I expected; there were tears there. I really dont like for Christmas to be over. Its my favorite time of the year. I hugged her, and then Im sure I made another lame Dad comment about how next year she will have a baby (due in early April) to celebrate Christmas with.             I miss it too, Amanda. Time passes so quickly, and those moments when we are together are the ones that I treasure most. They are all too few, and then theyre gone, and theres just a Christmas tree lying forlornly out in the alley. Except that we still have the memories. And this year I have the special memory of Amanda and those tears. I will never forget it. And I think when I see my mother tomorrow I will ask her too about some Christmases past. I bet that at 95 she can still remind me of a few special moments I have forgotten.             Have a great week. Thanks for spending yet another year with me. And I look forward to 2013 being the best and most interesting one ever.

Since then, half of the American government, the Senate, approved a bill that would cut taxes for many of those Americans. The bill has been sent to the other half of the American government, the House of Representatives, so it can be signed into law. But Republicans in the House of Representatives are disgruntled about the Fiscal Cliff bill the Senate approved and are threatening not to approve it. The Senate bill calls for massive tax cuts for most Americans, including the investor and owner class (dividend taxes will be much lower under the Senate bill than they are under the law that took effect last night). This puts the Republicans in an odd position, considering that the party's primary mission is to cut taxes: Taxes have already gone up. So the Republicans are now the only thing standing between America and a gigantic tax cut. SEE ALSO: Great News For Romney Voters -- Congress Just Socked It To The 47%\\n\", 'The Senate has approved a tax deal to blunt some of the impact of the Fiscal Cliff. There\\'s some great news for the investor and owner class in there: Dividend taxes won\\'t go up anywhere near as much as they would have with no deal. And income taxes will only rise for households making a healthy $450,000 or more--and, even then, not very much (just back to the Clinton-era 39.6%). And there\\'s other excellent news for those who regard America as a land of \"makers\" and \"takers.\" Congress just socked it to Mitt Romney\\'s famous 47%. Remember \"the 47%\"? They\\'re the Americans who Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said \"don\\'t take responsibility for themselves,\" because they make too little money to pay income taxes. (How dare they not make enough money to pay income taxes! How irresponsible and rude!) Of course, as many appalled Americans pointed out in the wake of Romney\\'s remarks, most of these folks are either seniors collecting Social Security or working Americans who make less than ~$50,000 a year. And most of the latter folks pay payroll taxes and other taxes, like sales taxes. But these folks are still held in low regard by those who consider themselves America\\'s makers. So there\\'s great news for these folks tucked into the Senate bill: By not extending the payroll tax cuts, the Senate agreed to raise payroll taxes on working Americans from 4.2% to 6.2%--a tax that will apply to the first $113,000 of earned income. This tax increase will hit anyone who earns money in this country, including \"the 47%.\" So, it\\'s almost like Romney got elected!

You can find the score on the 2nd page of this embedded document. The bill adds nearly $4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.

Tax Policy Center\\n', 'Venture capitalist Fred Wilson, of Union Square Ventures, has helped his firm post some of the best returns in the entire VC industry over the past five years. The firm\\'s performance has been nothing short of spectacular, and Fred Wilson\\'s reputation has justifiably soared. And yet, in 2012, even though USV had some amazing exits that coined money for the firm, its partners, and its clients, Wilson said in a recent blog post that he feels like it was a \"shitty year.\" Why? Because Wilson did not make a single investment in 2012. In fact, Wilson has not made a single investment since the summer of 2011--more than 18 months ago. For a firm that has made dozens of investments over the last five years, and has been on a tremendous roll, that is highly unusual. Usually, when firms and investors get on a hot streak, the partners get giddier and more aggressive as the streak continues. They begin to feel like they\\'re playing with \"house money,\" boatloads of it, and they start throwing that money at whatever strikes their fancy. They also feel pressure to continue to justify their reputations (and fees), and keep the momentum going. So when they\\'re not making investments, they feel like they\\'re \"doing nothing\"--resting on laurels based on past accomplishments having nothing do to with what they are doing right now. And yet, for those who have been around long enough to understand the ebb and flow of investment cycles, it is clear that \"doing nothing\" is often the smartest investment decision of all. Every great investment opportunity goes through this investment cycle. In the beginning, when the opportunity is truly \"speculative\"--when most people think investing in the opportunity is obviously stupid--a few brave souls make brave bets and then cash in on extraordinary early returns. Then, everyone else sees those returns, and the money rushes in. Soon, all the investment money bids up prices and creates a wave of competitors vying for the same opportunity, and investment returns begin to drop. Eventually, the \"fools\" rush in, bidding prices up to truly silly levels, and dozens of competitors fight over the tiny crumbs of opportunity left on the table. Then returns collapse and the cycle ends. The consumer Internet cycle that drove Union Square Ventures\\' returns over the past 5-7 years began to wind down a year or two ago. So many investors had jumped into the game, so many companies were attacking the opportunity, and valuations had gotten so high that expected returns for small startups had begun to drop. There was massive excitement in the sector, of course--and huge \"buzz\" (in part because so many people were in the game)--but the fundamentals were no longer attractive. So the smartest investors began to scale back and look elsewhere. Or, in the case of Union Square, they just began to say \"no.\" It\\'s hard to imagine how many serious business plans and opportunities Union Square has said \"no\" to over the past 18 months. If I had to guess, I\\'d say it was on the order of 10 per day, or about 500 over the period. And that\\'s just the serious ones. Saying \"no\" when the rest of the industry (and your competitors) are in a feeding frenzy is difficult. You often look and feel like an idiot. No matter how confident you are that the cycle has played out, you know that you might be wrong, and that you\\'ll end up with your reputation in tatters, looking like a fool. So saying \"no\" is extremely hard to do. But, in investing, it\\'s occasionally the smartest thing to do. So, even though Fred Wilson feels like he had a \"shitty year\" in 2012 because he didn\\'t make any new investments, it\\'s possible (likely, even) that he will end up having had a much better year than almost every other VC in the industry. In other words, Wilson may have demonstrated again that the performance Union Square has delivered over the past 5 years is no fluke and that he and his partners Brad Burnham and Albert Wenger deserve their reputations as one of the most talented investment teams in the industry.

While liberals were seen as the huge source of concern yesterday, in the House, the big challenge is for Boehner to bring the votes. A lot of conservatives hate the bill. Tea Party representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah tweeted his opposition:  That partially echoes the sentiment of Marro Rubio, one of just 8 Senators who voted \\'NO\\' last night. In a statement he said: â\\x80\\x9cThousands of small businesses, not just the wealthy, will now be forced to decide how they\\'ll pay this new tax and, chances are, they\\'ll do it by firing employees, cutting back their hours and benefits, or postponing the new hire they were looking to make. And to make matters worse, it does nothing to bring our dangerous debt under control.\" And here\\'s what Heritage Action said last night, when it urged politicians to vote NO. This kick-the-can approach, necessitated by a president who refuses to stop campaigning and start seriously addressing our nationâ\\x80\\x99s fiscal problems, is not an adequate solution to Americaâ\\x80\\x99s coming fiscal crisis, which is a result ofÂ\\xa0overspending, not under-taxing.Â\\xa0 Allowing a tax increase to hit a certain segment of Americans and small businesses is not a solution; when combined with the coming Obamacare tax increases, it all but ensures a weaker economy. ... Regardless of those provisions, it is clear that Washington continues to fail the American people.Â\\xa0 America needs less spending, less taxing and less borrowing by our government, which would allow more investment and job-creation by Americaâ\\x80\\x99s private sector economy. To date, President Obama hasÂ\\xa0proven to be fundamentally unseriousÂ\\xa0about tackling our nationâ\\x80\\x99s coming fiscal crisis. Â\\xa0America needs real leaders proposing real solutions, such as those found in Heritageâ\\x80\\x99sÂ\\xa0Saving the American DreamÂ\\xa0plan or even the previous House-passed budget.Â\\xa0 This kick-the-can approach falls woefully short. Heritage Action opposes the kick-the-can tax increase and will include it as a key vote on our legislative scorecard. So basically, conservatives want spending cuts NOW, and this bill doesn\\'t deliver. That being said, if the bill gets killed, taxes rise for everyone, and there\\'s still no new spending cuts. \\n', \"Most of the attention around the Fiscal Cliff has been focused on income taxes. The way the deal went down, a tiny portion of American taxpayers â\\x80\\x94 households that earn more than $450,000 per year â\\x80\\x94 will see their income taxes rise modestly, from 35% to 39.6%. Everyone else's income taxes will stay the same. But that's not the whole story. By not addressing the payroll tax, the Fiscal Cliff deal will also result in a tax hike for all working Americans, including those in the middle and poor classes. All income up to $110,000 will now be socked with a 2 point increase in the payroll tax, from 4.2% to 6.2%, which will pluck $2,000 out of the pockets of families making $100,000 a year. Meanwhile, thanks to a deal on dividend taxes, the highest earning Americans have gotten a massive tax cut over the taxes that would have taken effect had a Fiscal Cliff deal not been agreed to. Dividend taxes for households making more than $450,000 per year will rise from 15% to 20% (plus an additional 3.8% surcharge for Obamacare, to a total of 23.8%). But they won't rise all the way to 39.6%, which they were scheduled to rise to without a Fiscal Cliff deal. Meanwhile, dividend taxes for those earning less than $450,000 a year will remain at 15% (18.8% with the surcharge, for those with income between $250,000 and $450,000). So the richest Americans have dodged a big tax bullet. Importantly, the dividend tax deal will disproportionately help the richest Americans: In other words, the tax deal that Congress just agreed to will raise $125 billion from increased payroll taxes from all working Americans (poor and middle class alike), while saving the richest Americans at least $20 billion in dividend taxes. Some of the folks who will save money on dividend taxes will obviously pay more on wage income, so there will be some balancing. But some won't. So, be happy this morning, rich Americans! This is a great deal for you!

Only those with incomes of $400K and up will see an income tax increase. But the other half of the Fiscal Cliff, the sequester (the mandatorys pending cuts agreed to in the debt ceiling fight) has only been delayed, giving DC more time to fight over it. That means we've already scheduled a new Fiscal Cliff, and the bill agreed to last night has the date: March 1, 2013 (exactly two months from today). This is from page 154 of the bill (HT: @jesse_livermore)  What will be interesting timing-wise is when the Treasury says we will hit the hard debt ceiling.

Spending cuts will be delayed for 2 months to give the sides more time to address them. So why is the bill 157-pages long? Because when Washington does business and passes a huge bill, there are all kinds of little other pre-existing tax things most Americans have never heard of, but which needed to be extended, that also get into the bill. It's just how it works.       Some might think this is nefarious \\x97 that politicians see a huge bill and then sneak in all these random things.

Despite the fact that Facebook\\'s stock tanked once it hit the public markets, Wall Street analysts have largely issued \"buy\" recommendations for the stock. This is a problem, says the Journal because: What some see as the relentless \"buy, buy, buy\" optimism has deepened skepticism about the Wall Street stock-pitching machine. Critics say Facebook is a telling example of the divided loyalties at many firms, which woo lucrative investment-banking clients and then prod brokerage customers to buy the same stocks even if they look bruised. This is a very familiar, and very old story. But this time, it doesn\\'t really ring true. You see, when the banks that underwrote Facebook\\'s IPO started putting out their recommendations on the stock, they weren\\'t exactly glowing. Morgan Stanley, for instance, had a price target of $38 on the stock in its first research report. The IPO price was $38. That means Morgan Stanley\\'s analysts said any big institutional investor that bought the stock at $38 wasn\\'t going to see a gain on the investment in the next twelve months. We\\'re not exactly certain how this could be construed as some shady deal by Morgan Stanley to sucker people into buying Facebook stock. Other analysts with buy recommendations on Facebook also have price targets right around $38, which is an insult to the people that paid the IPO price. If there really was some grand conspiracy on the part of Facebook\\'s bankers to push off Facebook stock, the price targets would be much higher. The Journal also seems to be unhappy that even as banks lowered their price targets by a few dollars they maintained their buy ratings. This is just how it goes with sell-side analysts. Look at Apple. The price targets went way up, and have come way down, but overall, it\\'s still rated a \"buy.\" Investors can\\'t go on just buy or sell ratings. They need to read the reports and make up their minds. Also, maybe, just maybe, analysts actually think Facebook is going to go back to $40 a share. After all, it\\'s a company with 1 billion users and a big opportunity to monetize its mobile application, something it hasn\\'t yet done. It also has a chance to develop a new ad network. Big smart investors bought the stock at $38 a share for the IPO, which suggests they thought it was going to pop higher. This suggests that analysts who have twelve month price targets of $40 or more aren\\'t all that crazy or engaged in some sort of side dealing. They just think the stock is currently undervalued.\\n', 'Business InsiderWarren Buffett and (from left to right, photoshopped) Roy Welland, Ace Greenberg, Jimmy Cayne, Sylvia Moss, Steve Weinstein, and David EinhornPoker\\'s rise to prominence in the world of finance has pushed bridge, its more mature predecessor, from the limelight. There\\'s a reason, however, why the best bridge players in the country are almost all investors. Business Insider deputy editor and bridge enthusiast Gus Lubin notes: \"Bridge is a complex card game that fits the analytic side of finance, as poker appeals to instincts.\" A bridge devotee, Warren Buffett has famously declared, \"I wouldn\\'t mind going to jail if I had three cellmates who played bridge.\" But passion for the game has gotten some on Wall Street in trouble.

The Nasdaq is still down 40% from its high, and the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are essentially flat. European and Japanese equities have generally fared worse. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The average secular bear market in the US has been about 11 years, with the shortest to date being four years and the longest 20. Are we at the beginning of a new bull market or another seven years of famine? What sorts of returns should we expect over the coming years from US equities? \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Even if you have no investments in the stock market, this is an important question, in part because the pensions funded by state and local governments are heavily invested in US equities. In fact, they are often projecting returns in excess of 10% per year. How likely is that to happen? Who will make up the difference if it doesn\\x92t? In nearly all states and jurisdictions, it is against the law to change the terms of a public pension plan once it is agreed upon. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Even more important to you personally, what will happen to your taxes if the secular bear persists? On this final day of 2012, let\\x92s take a look at the potential returns of the stock market over the next 7-10 years. In previous Thoughts from the Frontline and in my book Bull\\x92s Eye Investing, I have written that stock market returns are a function of valuations (typically, price-to-earnings ratios). Secular bull markets are periods of rising valuations, while secular bear markets are periods of falling valuations. While stock market returns can vary widely over one-year, ten-year, or twenty-year periods, over the long term stock market earnings have tended to correlate very highly with GDP and inflation. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Since GDP has tended to grow (at least until recently) at 3% per year, predicting long-term returns and secular bull and bear markets has been pretty straightforward. But recently several noteworthy analysts have presented research suggesting that GDP will not grow anywhere close to 3% over the coming decades. In today\\x92s letter we look at the ramifications of slower GDP growth on equity returns. For most investors this is a very important topic, as the stock market tends to be the main driver of their investment returns. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At the beginning of the last decade I wrote that the US economy would be lucky to grow at 2% for the entire decade. Even though I was called a \\x93big bad bear\\x94 at the time, it turns out that I was an optimist. The economy grew at 1.7%. When asked about the present decade a few years ago, I cautiously said that we would be lucky to grow at 2% for the decade, which elicited more bearish name-calling. Now I once again find myself to be more optimistic than some of my colleagues. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Last summer Bill Gross (chief investment officer of PIMCO) forecast that the US economy would grow at only 1.5% over the next decade. Recently, Jeremy Grantham of GMO (one of my investment heroes) wrote a paper called On the Road to Zero Growth, in which he forecast that \\x93Going forward, GDP growth (conventionally measured) for the U.S. is likely to be about only 1.4% a year, and adjusted growth about 0.9%.\\x94 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Adding further to the sentiment, Dr. Robert Gordon, a very respected economist, wrote a paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research provocatively titled Is U.S. Economic Growth Over? Faltering Innovation Confronts the Six Headwinds. Quoting from the abstract: Even if innovation were to continue into the future at the rate of the two decades before 2007, the U.S. faces six headwinds that are in the process of dragging long-term growth to half or less of the 1.9 percent annual rate experienced between 1860 and 2007. These include demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy/environment, and the overhang of consumer and government debt. A provocative \\x93exercise in subtraction\\x94 suggests that future growth in consumption per capita for the bottom 99 percent of the income distribution could fall below 0.5 percent per year for an extended period of decades.\\x94 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Even if Gordon does measure growth somewhat unconventionally, his is a very sobering forecast. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Finally, we have a paper called 1%... The New Normal Growth Rate? Authored by Chris Brightman of Research Affiliates (the firm founded by my friend Rob Arnott), it presents their view that 1% is the \\x93new normal\\x94 growth rate. Chris follows up on research presented earlier, in which they described what they call the \\x933-D Hurricane\\x94 of deficits, debt, and demography. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My good friend (and no stranger to longtime readers of this letter) Ed Easterling of Crestmont Research (full bio at the end of this letter) and I were recently discussing these forecasts, finding humor in the fact that Grantham and Brightman, et al. were essentially calling Gross an optimist. But we definitely did not find anything funny about the implications of their forecasts on long-term stock market returns. We thereupon agreed to coauthor this letter, with the intention of helping you make your investment plans for the coming year. As we have done in the past, Ed wrote the first draft and I threw in a little editing and commenting, trying not to diminish the value of his research. And with that setup, let\\x92s jump right in. (Note: All graphs and charts are his.) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As noted above, the longer-term assessments for GDP growth are turning decidedly lower than the long-term 3% we saw over the last century. Our purpose in this letter is to look beyond the details of each argument as to the prospects for growth. That is, our objective is to understand the long-term implications of growth for stock market returns. Whether your favorite economist foresees 2%, 1%, or 0% long-term growth, the outcome for returns is similar in direction: the impact will lie somewhere between bad and worse. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The following discussion includes excerpts from Ed\\x92s book Probable Outcomes (and it\\x92s one I highly recommend \\x96 John). It explores the possibility that future real economic growth may have downshifted from its historical trend of 3% \\x96 and more significantly, it highlights the implications of that shift. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Historically, the prospect of slower economic growth has not often been considered by economists and analysts, but it now looms large in mainstream thinking. The effects of slower growth on stock market returns will be dramatic for investors. Shifts &amp; Cycles \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Most investors recognize that the stock market delivers extended periods of above-average and below-average returns. These periods are known as secular stock-market cycles. The last full secular bear was 1966-1981. The most recent secular bull ran from 1982-1999. Our current secular bear market started in 2000, and it still has a long way to go. Figure 1 presents all secular stock market periods since 1900. Figure 1. Secular Stock Market Cycles Mauldin \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 These secular periods are not the result of a random walk through good times and bad times. They are not periods of war or peace. They are not even alternating periods of recession and expansion in the economy. Rather, secular stock-market cycles are driven by changes in the overall value of the market. In other words, secular bull markets are periods when the price/earnings ratio (P/E) of the market rises and compounds returns, while secular bear markets are periods when P/E declines and compromises returns. The blue line near the bottom of Figure 1 shows the history of P/E. Rising P/E drives secular bulls (green-bar periods), and declining P/E drives secular bears (red-bar periods). \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Most important, the P/E cycle is not a coincidental wave nor a random walk. P/E is driven by the trend and level of the inflation rate. Higher inflation drives interest rates upward. Investors demand higher returns to offset the adverse impact of inflation. Thus, higher inflation drives P/E lower, so stock-market investors can achieve higher returns from lower prices and higher dividend yields. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Deflation also drives P/E lower. That occurs in response to an expected future of declining nominal earnings and dividends. And declining nominal cash flows during deflation drives current values lower. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Therefore, for more than a century, stock-market investors have endured secular stock-market cycles driven by the inflation-rate cycle. But there is a second variable that determines stock-market valuation. Until recently, that variable could be ignored because it was accepted as a constant. Over the decades, this second variable has seemed to crawl along like the notorious tortoise. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The second variable impacting stock-market value is the growth rate of earnings. Investors know that high-growth companies have higher P/Es than slower-growing, mature companies. The same principle applies to the market overall. It is especially relevant now that the constant of economic growth is uncertain. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 During the past century, real economic growth increased at an average of slightly more than 3% annually. As a result of the strong relationship between earnings and the economy, earnings per share (EPS) for the major stock market indexes also increased at near 3% in real terms. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 (This makes sense, because how can very broad market indexes grow any faster than the overall economy? Individual companies and industries can, of course, grow faster or slower; but the average is highly correlated with GDP growth plus inflation. \\x96 John) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 P/E generally peaked in the mid-20s (except during the Great Bubble of the late 1990s) and troughed below 10. The outside range for P/E, as well as its midpoint average near 15.5, occurred with such consistency because the growth rates of both the economy and earnings were so consistent over the long term, at close to 3%. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In effect, the growth rate determines the P/E range and midpoint, and the inflation rate determines the location and trend within the range. A change in growth rate causes a shift in the range. These two dynamics are illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 One effect of slower economic and earnings growth will be a lower level of earnings in the future. For example, over ten years, $1.00 compounds to $1.34 at 3%, but to only $1.22 at 2%. The difference is about 9.3% less EPS for the stock market under the slower growth scenario. Many analysts would consider that level of variance a minor forecasting error for EPS over a decade. Whether the stock market is 9% higher or lower in a decade is generally small change in the context of overall returns. But the implication of slower growth is far more significant than simply the ending level of earnings \\x96 slower growth is a game-changer. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There are three ways to assess the effects of slower growth, all of which provide similar results. First, an extremely long-term model of earnings growth, dividend payouts, and present value can be constructed to assess the impact of changes in growth on P/E. Second, academic formulas can be employed to derive the effects on P/E based upon perpetual dividend growth. Third, the impact on P/E can be evaluated through the components of stock-market returns. Since all three approaches reflect comparable results, the more pragmatic third approach will be used here to explore the implications. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Before examining the details, consider the significance of the issue. If the future growth rate of earnings decreases by 1% (i.e., near the reduction that would be expected if economic growth decreases by 1%), the historical average for P/E would decline from 15.5 to 11.5 \\x96amounting to a 26% decline in the stock market beyond the 9% shortfall from lower earnings growth. Even more dramatically, the typical peak in P/E would fall from the low to mid 20s to the mid-teens \\x96 the adverse impact of slower growth increases at higher levels of P/E. (This is explained in further detail below.) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As discussed above, inflation causes P/E to decrease because investors demand higher returns in compensation. Unlike the inflation rate, though, the growth rate of earnings does not necessarily change the return level that investors expect. They will still expect returns that are commensurate with the stock market and the expected inflation rate, but they will look to replace the contribution of slower earnings growth with another source of return. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To illustrate, assuming that a change in the growth rate does not change the inflation rate, the yields on government bonds can be expected to remain the same. Absent a change in credit quality from slower growth, the risk premium for corporate bond yields will not change. Likewise, the expected return from stock-market investments can be expected to remain unchanged due to the growth rate. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When slower growth reduces the contribution of earnings growth to total return, another source of return is therefore needed to make up the shortfall. Stock-market investors are not willing to take equity risk without appropriate equity returns. If bond yields do not change, they will not compromise stock-market returns. In this situation, stock-market investors will step away until the price of the market declines until it again provides adequate returns. This is the function of markets: finding the price that provides a fair return. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This discussion relates to the effect from changes in the growth rate of earnings. To isolate that factor, several assumptions are needed, basically providing that the relevant relationships remain the same. First, based upon the previous economics discussion, a downshift in economic growth drives slower earnings growth. Second, long-term profit margins remain similar under both growth scenarios; thus the slowing of earnings growth is consistent with the downshift in economic growth. Third, the inflation rate remains constant across both scenarios for growth. Fourth, the expected return for stocks and bonds as well as the related equity risk premium for stocks does not change across both scenarios for growth. In other words, the relevant relationships remain constant. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Of the three components of stock-market returns, two are available as sources of return, and the third one represents the way in which returns occur. The first source of return, EPS growth, is defined in this example as providing either 3% or 2% toward to the total return (\\x93Historical Growth\\x94 and \\x93Slower Growth\\x94 bars in Figure 2). As a result, the second source of return, dividend yield, will need to increase to compensate for lower earnings growth in the slower-growth scenario. Herein lies the role of the third source of stock-market returns: changes in P/E. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The dividend yield rises as P/E declines, and vice versa. For the stock market to be positioned to provide equity-level returns, investors will look for the lower price that enables the dividend yield to rise sufficiently to offset the loss of earnings growth. The required decline in P/E varies based upon the starting level of P/E. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If P/E starts relatively high, then a higher decline is required to provide the required dividend yield increase. For example, if EPS growth drops by 1%, then the change in P/E required to increase the dividend yield by 1% is 7 points (from 22 to 15), 4 points (from 15.5 to 11.5), and 2 points (from 10 to 8). \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This shift in P/E relates only to the change in earnings growth. P/E would then be further affected by changes in the inflation rate. Figure 3 provides another graphic illustration of the dynamics of the shift and growth cycles. The shift is related to changes in growth rate, and the cycle is driven by inflation-rate trends and levels. Figure 3. Impact of Growth Rate and Inflation Rate on P/E Mauldin As previously mentioned, the two other methodologies provide similar results. A change in the forecast for future earnings due to slower growth results in lower present values. Likewise, the reduction in the growth-rate variable in traditional academic models also produces lower current values. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Well, what about Bill Gross\\x92 future of 1.5% growth, Chris Brightman\\x92s outlook for 1% growth, and Jeremy Grantham\\x92s ultimate rate of 0.4% growth? Two-percent growth downshifts the future average P/E from 15.5 to 11.5. If that is not concerning enough, note that a one-percent growth rate resets the long-term average P/E to near 9. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At this point in time, there is a significant disconnect between the market\\x92s expectation of future growth and the vision of these notable sages. P/E, normalized for the business cycle, is near 20. That is consistent with the current low inflation rate and historical average growth rates. Should it become apparent that either factor might change, beware the adverse impact of another P/E cycle, a new era with P/E shifting downward, or the compounded effects of both concurrently. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 There will likely be, and needs to be, much debate about the accuracy of the estimates presented above, and about nuances that could add decimal points to the factors or adjust the effects based upon further scenario assumptions. However, whether using long-term models, academic formulas, or the component-based method, all three approaches provide similar results. It is therefore important to recognize that slower growth will have a significant impact on P/E at all levels of the inflation rate. As the discussion evolves into implications and probable outcomes over this decade, slower economic and earnings growth will have a direct effect on the P/E range. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We are frequently asked how we expect lower valuations to manifest themselves. The single-digit P/E ratios that are typical of the end of a secular bear market and the beginning of a secular bull market would mean either a significant drop in the current valuation of the stock market or a prolonged sideways market. A general awareness and acceptance of a slower-growth economy would certainly help bring about lower valuations. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investors are confronting the reality of the current secular bear market, which is both a consequence of the previous secular bull market and a precursor to the next secular bull. The duration of the current secular bear period is uncertain. Should higher inflation or deflation overcome the currently rather stable inflation regime in the near term, this secular bear could end sooner, as that would drive valuations down. That outcome, however, would cause significant losses to stock market portfolios. If, however, inflation or deflation slowly creeps into the economy \\x96 over the next decade, for example \\x96 then this secular bear will be one of the longer ones. However, if this decade repeats the relatively low inflation of the past decade, then the secular bear may linger longer than any of us would like. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Beyond the inflation rate, economic growth will also have an impact on the future of this secular bear. Following last decade\\x92s below-average economic growth, if we are to return to the 3% historic growth trend, then this decade must soon start to generate above-average growth to offset the recent shortfall. The result would be a solid boost to earnings in this decade. However, economic growth could also have downshifted during the last decade to a lower level that will persist for the foreseeable future. The result would be a significantly lower range of P/Es, but not necessarily a progression through and out of the secular bear market. The economic growth rate can shift P/E upward or downward, but only inflation or deflation can kill a secular bear. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Whether this secular bear cycle ends in five years, ten years, or beyond, the ultimate outcome will be the start of the next secular bull market, which will bring an extended period of above-average returns. Spring will finally have sprung. There is a rainbow out there somewhere. This longer-term view of secular stock market cycles lets us look out across this secular bear to the next secular bull. The operative word is \\x93across\\x94 this secular bear and not past it. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\x93Across\\x94 recognizes the reality of the risks and opportunities presented by the secular bear in whose grip we find ourselves. \\x93Past\\x94 suggests the ostrich-like approach of ignoring reality in the blind hope of an unrealistic outcome. \\x93Across\\x94 is enabling, while \\x93past\\x94 is disabling. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For investors who are accumulating for the future, secular bear markets are times to build savings for later investment. This is done not only through contributions but also through prudent investing by means of an absolute-return approach. The absolute-return approach uses the dual strategy of risk management and investment selection. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investment portfolios should be diversified across a range of investments that are diligently selected and actively managed, especially ones that control risk and enhance return. Investors should not avoid the stock market nor bond market altogether. Instead, their objective should be to seek, in both markets, investments that incorporate elements of skill to enhance returns. Secular bear markets are not periods during which to avoid investing; they are periods that demand an adjustment to investment strategy as well as to expectations regarding what potential returns can be. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For investors in pension funds and retirees who are more dependent on their current assets, early recognition is key to the investment strategy. The principles of absolute-return investing are important for preserving capital and generating much-needed returns; but it is potentially even more important for these investors to manage their assumptions and expectations. Recognizing secular-bear market conditions earlier enables investors to make potentially painful adjustments more easily and with less damage. Delaying action until crisis has onset generally brings adverse consequences! Hoping that the next secular bull market will arrive quickly is not a prudent way to address shortfalls. The longer it takes you to adjust expectations, the greater the gap to you will have to fill and the shorter the time you will have to fill it. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 This strategy applies most of all to those entrusted with the management of pensions, both private and public. The largest fraction of the monies a pension fund will pay out in the future is expected to come from investment growth. At the beginning of the last decade, pension funds were routinely expecting to get 8% or higher returns on their investment portfolios. Those projections have proved a dismal illusion. Yet pension funds continue to anticipate 7-8% returns going forward. The very people who should know best that past performance is not indicative of future results are expecting the stock market to return to past performance to give them their longed-for results. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 These pension-fund shortfalls will mean higher required contributions from corporations. More important, and urgently, they also mean higher required funding for public pensions from taxpayers, accompanied by a reduction of promised benefits. We do not see how the state of Illinois, for example, can meet its obligations without a significant restructuring of its pension plans or its budget, or more likely both. While those receiving pensions would prefer higher taxes on those funding them, there is a limit to what taxpayers will bear. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Sadly, we\\x92re going to find that this is not just an Illinois problem, but one that will become apparent in states, cities, and counties all across the country. This is going to cause a great deal of distress for everyone concerned. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Finally, a comment on GDP growth. The downbeat forecasts mentioned at the beginning of the letter are all based on different methodologies, and we will venture one further argument. It is highly likely that taxes are going to increase over the next few years, and not just due to the current \\x93fiscal cliff\\x94 issue. No matter which path is chosen in the short term, it seems improbable that a true resolution to the total deficit issue will be accomplished. More deficit-reduction work will be needed. That means spending cuts, accompanied by yet more tax increases. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 However you view the prospect of increased taxes, there is no way to get around the fact that they will reduce general savings. If you reduce savings you reduce the capital available for investment in current and future businesses. If you reduce capital formation, you\\x92re going to reduce future growth. The current fetish among the economic thought leaders is that consumption is the driver of GDP growth. But GDP growth is ultimately a reflection of increases in population and productivity. And if you want to increase productivity, you must increase capital available for investment. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Note that this is a circular argument. If we increase taxes, we reduce the potential for GDP growth by reducing the capital available for investment, which of course makes the rosy growth projections of government forecasters fall short, thus driving future deficits even higher, minus further deficit-reduction efforts. As Chris Brightman writes: The most important determinant of our productivity per person is the amount of capital we have available for investment, and wise use of that capital. Investing to improve productivity in all of its forms, from machine tools, to transportation infrastructure, to education, can all raise our productivity. Investing requires savings, and we have been saving far too little. To increase productivity requires that we reorient our economy away from debt-financed consumption and toward saving-financed investment. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The politicians in Washington all give lip service to the need for growth. But then they turn around and do the very things that make it more difficult for the economy to grow. And as we have seen, this is going to make it more difficult for the stock market to return to a secular bull path. Which will create a greater need for higher taxes and/or reduced spending on the state and local levels. Which of course hurts GDP growth. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 We are coming to the Endgame. There are no easy solutions, only very difficult ones. And none of them bode well for future equity valuations. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 John here: I can tell you that there is deep concern when Ed and I talk about the consequences of government actions and potentially slow GDP growth for the average investor. All too few people understand the links between government decisions and their retirement portfolios. If you are reading this letter, you are one of those few. You do have options, but there are no easy options any more. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For those interested in cycles I suggest you take a close look at Ed\\x92s books, Unexpected Returns and Probable Outcomes, and his excellent website, www.Crestmontresearch.com. It is a treasure trove of knowledge. At the beginning of each year, Ed updates most of the website\\x92s charts and graphs, many of which were included in one or both of his books. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I also recently wrote a paper along these lines, published by my partners at Altegris, on its home page (to access it, first you must indicate what type of investor you are). My paper focuses on managed futures, and you\\x92ll find other papers on alternative investments, along with a lot of worthwhile research Altegris has done. \\x93Alternative investing\\x94 is increasingly a part of accepted investing methodology. In my opinion, alternatives should be defined broadly to mean not sitting back and depending on \\x93buy and hope\\x94 (otherwise known as buy and hold) equity indexes. We will have reason to explore this topic further in the coming year! \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You will likely be getting this letter on New Year\\x92s Eve. Let me wish you a very happy and prosperous new year. I\\x92m going to begin the new year by flying to Santa Barbara to be with my friend and partner Jon Sundt of Altegris Investments at his home up at the Hollister Ranch. While we will spend some time, as we always do, talking about alternative investments and ways to make them more readily available to investors, I will spend the bulk of my time thinking about my annual forecast letter, which I will write this coming weekend. I spend more time researching this one letter than anything else I write, and this year will be no different. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I\\x92ll fly back on Saturday and then leave Sunday afternoon for Europe. I\\x92ll be there for over two weeks. The first portion of the trip, I will be in Scandinavia on a speaking tour for Skagen Funds. I am finalizing details for the remaining time, but I intend to go to Greece and then make a quick stop in Geneva. I really want to experience Greece firsthand, rather than just through the eyes of other writers. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I will fly to Toronto on Sunday, January 27 to spend some time with my friend David Rosenberg. He has recently returned from Jerusalem (or, as he wrote me, \\x93Yerushalayim\\x94), where he celebrated the bar mitzvah of his youngest son, Mikey. Mazel tov, young man. Then I\\x92ll meet with my longtime friend and natural-resource maven Rick Rule and the team at Sprott Asset Management. And that evening I\\x92ll do a speech for my Canadian partner, John Nicola of Nicola Wealth Management. (If you are interested in attending the speech, drop me a note and I will send it on to John N.) From Toronto, I\\x92ll probably move on to New York and DC. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Let me suggest that you spend a few moments with this most-excellent, if somewhat sad, video of the music of the great artists who graced our lives and passed away this year. I admit to having played it a few times. Thanks to each of them for the memories. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 My daughter Amanda took it upon herself to decorate my home for Christmas this year. We went out and bought a tree right after Thanksgiving, and then she took over. I must admit, it was more festive in the house than I remember it ever being. And the tree was quite fragrant. Also, the family was around more, for whatever reason. They just seemed to want to be together more this year. It was a great time and I enjoyed being home with the kids and grandkids and having some time off from the road. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Yesterday, Amanda also ended up with the task of putting everything away. She up to my office, where I was, as usual, reading and writing. She had a sad look on her face. \\x93Dad, I hate putting up the Christmas stuff. It\\x92s so sad.\\x94 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I made some lame comment about time passing and how much fun it had been and how she had made the house so beautiful. And then I looked in her eyes. I did not see what I expected; there were tears there. \\x93I really don\\x92t like for Christmas to be over. It\\x92s my favorite time of the year.\\x94 I hugged her, and then I\\x92m sure I made another lame Dad comment about how next year she will have a baby (due in early April) to celebrate Christmas with. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 I miss it too, Amanda. Time passes so quickly, and those moments when we are together are the ones that I treasure most. They are all too few, and then they\\x92re gone, and there\\x92s just a Christmas tree lying forlornly out in the alley. Except that we still have the memories. And this year I have the special memory of Amanda and those tears. I will never forget it. And I think when I see my mother tomorrow I will ask her too about some Christmases past. I bet that at 95 she can still remind me of a few special moments I have forgotten. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have a great week.
